## Known Bugs to Fix

**None!** âœ… All known bugs fixed in Session 26.

## Session 27 User Testing Results âœ…

**Testing Completed:** October 24, 2025 (2:43pm - 3:29pm, 46 minutes)

**Test Game Details:**
- **Duration:** 90 moves (White victory by checkmate)
- **Time Controls:** 30/10/5/0 (White: 30min+10sec, Black: 5min+0sec)
- **Skill Level:** 20 for both engines (maximum strength)
- **Opponent:** White = External Stockfish 17.1 app (30sec/move thinking)
- **iOS Engine:** Black = iOS Stockfish 17 (Level 20)

**Test Results - ALL SYSTEMS VALIDATED:**

âœ… **Engine Stability** - No crashes, freezes, or memory issues over
   90-move game
âœ… **Strong Tactical Play** - Held even position through move 44 despite
   severe time handicap
âœ… **Endgame Resilience** - Forced opponent pawn promotion at move 83
   with <25 seconds remaining
âœ… **Time Controls** - Increments working, no forfeit despite time
   pressure
âœ… **PGN Notation** - Check symbols (+) at moves 50, 51, 86; Checkmate
   symbol (#) at move 90
âœ… **Game-Ending Alert** - Checkmate properly detected and displayed
âœ… **Position Evaluation** - On-demand evaluation working without freezes
âœ… **UCI Protocol** - All 90 moves executed correctly

**Performance Analysis:**
iOS Stockfish engine performed **exceptionally well** under extreme
stress conditions:
- 5-minute time allocation vs opponent's 30 minutes + increments
- Opponent taking 30+ seconds per move (much deeper search)
- Survived 90 moves and forced opponent pawn promotion in endgame
- Playing at maximum strength (Skill Level 20) with proper depth tuning

**Conclusion:** iOS Stockfish engine is **PRODUCTION READY** ðŸš€

**Next Priority:** File Management Features (Phase 3)

## Agenda for Next Session

**PRIORITY ORDER - Core Features Before Online Features:**

The correct development sequence is to complete ALL core/local features
BEFORE implementing online opponents (Lichess/Chess.com). Online APIs
add network complexity that should only be tackled after the local
foundation is solid and fully tested.

**#1: Threefold Repetition Draw Rule (Chess Rule Completion)**

**Overview:** Implement the threefold repetition rule - a fundamental
chess rule allowing a draw when the same position occurs three times.

**Implementation Strategy: Option A (Skill-Aware System)**
- Human player: Alert with choice to claim draw or continue playing
- AI player: Evaluate position and decide based on skill level
  - If losing badly (using draw offer threshold): Auto-claim draw
  - If winning/equal: Continue playing
- Works correctly with Stockfish color selection (Session 23 feature)
- Works correctly with Human vs Human mode (Session 17 feature)

**Technical Approach (In-Memory Only - No File I/O):**
```swift
// In ChessGame.swift
var positionHistory: [String] = []  // NEW - FEN position keys in RAM

func generatePositionKey() -> String {
    // Only 4 FEN components matter (NOT all 6):
    // - Piece placement (board state)
    // - Active player (w/b)
    // - Castling rights (KQkq)
    // - En passant target
    // EXCLUDE: halfmove clock, fullmove number
    return "\(pieces) \(player) \(castling) \(enPassant)"
}

func checkThreefoldRepetition() -> Bool {
    guard let lastPosition = positionHistory.last else { return false }
    let count = positionHistory.filter { $0 == lastPosition }.count
    return count >= 3
}
```

**After Each Move:**
1. Append position key to positionHistory array
2. Check if current position appears 3+ times
3. If threefold detected, call handleThreefoldRepetition()

**AI Logic (Reuse Draw Offer Threshold):**
```swift
let threshold = -(100 + (skillLevel * 10))
if (evaluation < threshold) {
    // AI is losing, claim draw automatically
} else {
    // AI is winning/equal, continue playing
}
```

**Human Alert Text:**
```
"Threefold Repetition"
"The same position has occurred three times.
You may claim a draw."

[Claim Draw]  [Continue Playing]
```

**Testing FEN (Berlin Defense - Early Repetition):**
Use positions with repetitive knight moves to trigger threefold quickly.

**Memory Impact:** Negligible (~60 chars per move, 90-move game = ~5KB)

**Cleanup:** Clear positionHistory on New Game, Setup Board, Undo (if needed)

**Note:** This is separate from auto-save FEN files (Phase 3 - File
Management). Threefold repetition uses in-memory tracking only.

**#2: File Management Features (Terminal Parity)**
- **Auto-save settings** - Settings toggles for auto-save FEN/PGN on
  game end (matches terminal FENON/FENOFF, PGNON/PGNOFF)
- **Save location picker** - Settings option to choose iCloud Drive vs
  On My iPhone as default save location
- **Auto-save on game end** - Automatically save FEN/PGN when game ends
  (checkmate/stalemate/resignation/draw/time forfeit) if toggles enabled
- **Import FEN with navigation** - Load .fen files with position-by-
  position navigation (terminal LOAD FEN parity)
- **Import PGN with navigation** - Load .pgn files with move-by-move
  navigation (terminal LOAD PGN parity)
- **Share Game feature** - iOS share sheet for mid-game FEN/PGN sharing
  (AirDrop, Messages, Email, Clipboard)
- **Manual save** - Save current game to file via iOS document picker

**#3: Opening Library Integration**
- Load 24 validated FEN files from terminal project
- Browse and select openings for study/practice

**#4: Game Statistics Display**
- ScoreView enhancements: move count, capture count, time elapsed

**THEN: Online Opponents (Phase 3 - Later)**
- Lichess API integration
- Chess.com API integration
- Multi-engine testing with all 4 opponents

**Rationale:** User testing ensures stability before adding complexity.
File operations are core functionality needed regardless of opponent type.
Users need to save/load games whether playing against Stockfish offline
or online opponents. Complete local features first, then add network
complexity.

## Technical Context

**Key Architecture:**
- SwiftUI with MVVM pattern
- ChessEngine protocol for multi-engine support (Stockfish implemented)
- @Published properties for reactive UI updates
- @AppStorage for persistence (board theme, settings, time controls)
- Custom alert overlays using ZStack + semi-transparent backgrounds
- Cburnett SVG chess pieces from Wikimedia Commons
- **On-demand evaluation** - Position evaluation only when user opens
  ScoreView (prevents concurrent UCI requests)

**Recent Technical Decisions (Session 26):**
- **Occam's Razor victory** - On-demand evaluation is simpler and better
  than automatic background evaluation
- PGN check/checkmate notation matches chess standards (`+` and `#`)
- Time forfeit alerts match resign pattern for consistent UX
- Debug statements removed for clean console output (kept ERROR prints
  for production debugging)

**Testing Protocol:**
- User performs all builds and testing
- Zero-warning compilation required
- Test on iPhone simulator (iPhone 14 Pro minimum)
- Verify responsive design across device sizes
- **Extended gameplay testing** - Multiple complete games to verify stability

## Development Standards Reminder

1. **Zero Warnings** - All code must compile with zero warnings
2. **User Handles Git** - Developer never performs git operations
3. **TODO Management** - Update tracking section immediately when
   adding/removing TODOs
4. **Documentation Line Length** - 80 characters maximum in .md files
5. **Incremental Development** - Test after every significant change
6. **Occam's Razor** - Simple solutions preferred; if fighting same bug
   for 2+ sessions, question the approach

## Questions for User

1. Ready for extended user testing (multiple complete games)?
2. Any issues discovered since evaluation freeze fix?
3. Should we proceed with File Management features after testing confirms
   stability?
