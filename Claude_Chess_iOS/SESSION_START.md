**Created:** September 30, 2025
**Last Session:** October 24, 2025 (Session 26 continued)
**Development Stage:** Fully playable chess game with complete Stockfish AI
integration, on-demand position evaluation, professional UX with custom
game-ending alerts, FEN/PGN display/export with standard headers, in-app
User Guide with share functionality, and Contact Developer feature

  ContentView.swift, ScoreView.swift, StockfishEngine.swift

**TODO Count:** 5 (unchanged - all future Phase 3 features)

## Current TODO Inventory (5 Total)

**Phase 3 - UI & Display (1 TODO):**
- ScoreView.swift (line 58) - Display game statistics

**Phase 3 - Game Management (4 TODOs):**
- GameMenuView.swift (line 80) - Import FEN action (load .fen files with
  position navigation + save prompt)
- GameMenuView.swift (line 86) - Import PGN action (load .pgn files with
  move-by-move navigation + save prompt)

  file operations)

## Known Bugs to Fix

**None!** âœ… All known bugs fixed in Session 26.

## Agenda for Session 27

**PRIORITY ORDER - Core Features Before Online Features:**

The correct development sequence is to complete ALL core/local features
BEFORE implementing online opponents (Lichess/Chess.com). Online APIs
add network complexity that should only be tackled after the local
foundation is solid and fully tested.

**#1: USER TESTING (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
- **Full Stockfish vs Stockfish games** - User plays multiple complete
  games to validate all features work correctly under normal gameplay
- **Test scenarios:**
  - Multiple games with time controls
  - Games ending in checkmate, stalemate, resignation, time forfeit
  - Verify score evaluation on-demand works without freezing
  - Test draw offers at various skill levels
  - Verify PGN notation includes check/checkmate symbols
  - Test all game-ending alerts and board review functionality
- **Goal:** Confirm app is stable and bug-free before adding new features

**#2: File Management Features (Terminal Parity)**
- **Auto-save settings** - Settings toggles for auto-save FEN/PGN on
  game end (matches terminal FENON/FENOFF, PGNON/PGNOFF)
- **Save location picker** - Settings option to choose iCloud Drive vs
  On My iPhone as default save location
- **Auto-save on game end** - Automatically save FEN/PGN when game ends
  (checkmate/stalemate/resignation/draw/time forfeit) if toggles enabled
- **Import FEN with navigation** - Load .fen files with position-by-
  position navigation (terminal LOAD FEN parity)
- **Import PGN with navigation** - Load .pgn files with move-by-move
  navigation (terminal LOAD PGN parity)
- **Share Game feature** - iOS share sheet for mid-game FEN/PGN sharing
  (AirDrop, Messages, Email, Clipboard)
- **Manual save** - Save current game to file via iOS document picker

**#3: Opening Library Integration**
- Load 24 validated FEN files from terminal project
- Browse and select openings for study/practice

**#4: Game Statistics Display**
- ScoreView enhancements: move count, capture count, time elapsed

**THEN: Online Opponents (Phase 3 - Later)**
- Lichess API integration
- Chess.com API integration
- Multi-engine testing with all 4 opponents

**Rationale:** User testing ensures stability before adding complexity.
File operations are core functionality needed regardless of opponent type.
Users need to save/load games whether playing against Stockfish offline
or online opponents. Complete local features first, then add network
complexity.

## Technical Context

**Key Architecture:**
- SwiftUI with MVVM pattern
- ChessEngine protocol for multi-engine support (Stockfish implemented)
- @Published properties for reactive UI updates
- @AppStorage for persistence (board theme, settings, time controls)
- Custom alert overlays using ZStack + semi-transparent backgrounds
- Cburnett SVG chess pieces from Wikimedia Commons
- **On-demand evaluation** - Position evaluation only when user opens
  ScoreView (prevents concurrent UCI requests)

**Recent Technical Decisions (Session 26):**
- **Occam's Razor victory** - On-demand evaluation is simpler and better
  than automatic background evaluation
- PGN check/checkmate notation matches chess standards (`+` and `#`)
- Time forfeit alerts match resign pattern for consistent UX
- Debug statements removed for clean console output (kept ERROR prints
  for production debugging)

**Testing Protocol:**
- User performs all builds and testing
- Zero-warning compilation required
- Test on iPhone simulator (iPhone 14 Pro minimum)
- Verify responsive design across device sizes
- **Extended gameplay testing** - Multiple complete games to verify stability

## Development Standards Reminder

1. **Zero Warnings** - All code must compile with zero warnings
2. **User Handles Git** - Developer never performs git operations
3. **TODO Management** - Update tracking section immediately when
   adding/removing TODOs
4. **Documentation Line Length** - 80 characters maximum in .md files
5. **Incremental Development** - Test after every significant change
6. **Occam's Razor** - Simple solutions preferred; if fighting same bug
   for 2+ sessions, question the approach

## Questions for User

1. Ready for extended user testing (multiple complete games)?
2. Any issues discovered since evaluation freeze fix?
3. Should we proceed with File Management features after testing confirms
   stability?
