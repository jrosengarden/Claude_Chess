# Session 25 Start - Claude Chess iOS

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Previous Session:** Session 24 (Game-Ending Alerts, FEN/PGN Display & PGN Standard Features)

## Session Startup Protocol

1. âœ… Read this SESSION_START.md document
2. âœ… Review last 6 git log entries for recent changes context
3. âœ… Scan CLAUDE.md Session History (Session 19-24) for current state
4. âœ… Check TODO Tracking section (currently 5 TODOs)

## Project Status Summary

**Current Phase:** Phase 3 IN PROGRESS ðŸ”„ - Game Features & Polish
**Created:** September 30, 2025
**Last Session:** October 19, 2025 (Session 24)
**Development Stage:** Fully playable chess game with complete Stockfish AI integration,
professional UX with custom game-ending alerts, FEN/PGN display/export with standard headers

## Session 24 Accomplishments

**Major Features Completed:**
1. âœ… **Resign functionality** - Custom alert overlay with winner's pawn
2. âœ… **Game-ending alerts** - Professional custom overlays for all endings (checkmate/stalemate/draw/resignation)
3. âœ… **FEN display** - Custom alert with horizontal scroll, copy with auto-dismiss
4. âœ… **PGN display** - Custom alert with move history, proper result tracking
5. âœ… **PGN FEN headers** - Standard `[SetUp "1"]` and `[FEN "..."]` tags for Setup Board positions
6. âœ… **Setup Board bug fixes** - Cleared last-move indicators and enabled Start Game button

**Files Modified:**
- QuickGameMenuView.swift - Resign, FEN display, PGN display implementations
- ChessBoardView.swift - Custom game-ending alert overlays
- ChessGame.swift - checkmateWinner property, generatePGN() with FEN headers, setupFromFEN() fixes
- StockfishSettingsView.swift - Fixed deprecated onChange syntax

**TODO Count:** 9 â†’ 5 (removed Resign, FEN display, PGN display TODOs)

## Current TODO Inventory (5 Total)

**Phase 3 - UI & Display (1 TODO):**
- ScoreView.swift (line 46) - Display game statistics

**Phase 3 - Game Management (4 TODOs):**
- GameMenuView.swift (line 80) - Import FEN action (load .fen files with position navigation + save prompt)
- GameMenuView.swift (line 86) - Import PGN action (load .pgn files with move-by-move navigation + save prompt)
- GameMenuView.swift (line 92) - Share Game action (mid-game sharing via iOS share sheet)
- GameMenuView.swift (line 143) - Save current game to file (Phase 3 - file operations)

## Known Bugs to Fix

**Time Forfeit Alert UI Issue:**
- **Problem:** When time expires, alert shows only "OK" button which clears
  board to starting position and locks the board (can't review final position,
  view PGN/FEN, etc.)
- **Expected Behavior:** Match Resign alert pattern with two buttons:
  - "OK" - Returns to game board for review (board locked, "Start Game"
    disabled, can still view PGN/FEN)
  - "New Game" - Immediately starts fresh game
- **File:** ChessBoardView.swift (time forfeit alert)
- **Priority:** High - UX regression discovered in Session 25

## Agenda for Session 26

**Priority Items (User to decide):**

**Option 1: File Management Features**
- Import FEN files with position navigation (terminal LOAD FEN parity)
- Import PGN files with move-by-move navigation (terminal LOAD PGN parity)
- Share Game feature (iOS share sheet for FEN/PGN)
- Save current game to file (iOS document picker)

**Option 2: Game Statistics Display**
- ScoreView enhancements: move count, capture count, time elapsed
- Game statistics panel with detailed metrics

**Option 3: Testing & Polish**
- Comprehensive testing of all Phase 3 features
- UI/UX refinements based on user testing
- Performance optimization if needed

**Option 4: User's Choice**
- User may have specific feature requests or bug reports

## Technical Context

**Key Architecture:**
- SwiftUI with MVVM pattern
- ChessEngine protocol for multi-engine support (Stockfish implemented)
- @Published properties for reactive UI updates
- @AppStorage for persistence (board theme, settings, time controls)
- Custom alert overlays using ZStack + semi-transparent backgrounds
- Cburnett SVG chess pieces from Wikimedia Commons

**Recent Technical Decisions:**
- PGN standard FEN headers (`[SetUp "1"]` and `[FEN "..."]`) universally supported by chess programs
- Custom alert overlays preferred over standard SwiftUI alerts for better UX
- 1-second confirmation with auto-dismiss for copy actions
- setupFromFEN() must clear all game state (last move, flags, timer) to prevent bugs

**Testing Protocol:**
- User performs all builds and testing
- Zero-warning compilation required
- Test on iPhone simulator (iPhone 14 Pro minimum)
- Verify responsive design across device sizes

## Development Standards Reminder

1. **Zero Warnings** - All code must compile with zero warnings
2. **User Handles Git** - Developer never performs git operations
3. **TODO Management** - Update tracking section immediately when adding/removing TODOs
4. **Documentation Line Length** - 80 characters maximum in .md files
5. **Incremental Development** - Test after every significant change

## Questions for User

1. Which priority area should we focus on for Session 25?
2. Any bugs or issues discovered during Session 24 testing?
3. Any specific feature requests or UX improvements?
