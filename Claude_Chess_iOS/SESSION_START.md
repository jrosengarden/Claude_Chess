# Session 25 Start - Claude Chess iOS

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Previous Session:** Session 24 (Game-Ending Alerts, FEN/PGN Display & PGN Standard Features)

## Session Startup Protocol

1. âœ… Read this SESSION_START.md document
2. âœ… Review last 6 git log entries for recent changes context
3. âœ… Scan CLAUDE.md Session History (Session 19-24) for current state
4. âœ… Check TODO Tracking section (currently 5 TODOs)

## Project Status Summary

**Current Phase:** Phase 3 IN PROGRESS ðŸ”„ - Game Features & Polish
**Created:** September 30, 2025
**Last Session:** October 19, 2025 (Session 24)
**Development Stage:** Fully playable chess game with complete Stockfish AI integration,
professional UX with custom game-ending alerts, FEN/PGN display/export with standard headers

## Session 24 Accomplishments

**Major Features Completed:**
1. âœ… **Resign functionality** - Custom alert overlay with winner's pawn
2. âœ… **Game-ending alerts** - Professional custom overlays for all endings (checkmate/stalemate/draw/resignation)
3. âœ… **FEN display** - Custom alert with horizontal scroll, copy with auto-dismiss
4. âœ… **PGN display** - Custom alert with move history, proper result tracking
5. âœ… **PGN FEN headers** - Standard `[SetUp "1"]` and `[FEN "..."]` tags for Setup Board positions
6. âœ… **Setup Board bug fixes** - Cleared last-move indicators and enabled Start Game button

**Files Modified:**
- QuickGameMenuView.swift - Resign, FEN display, PGN display implementations
- ChessBoardView.swift - Custom game-ending alert overlays
- ChessGame.swift - checkmateWinner property, generatePGN() with FEN headers, setupFromFEN() fixes
- StockfishSettingsView.swift - Fixed deprecated onChange syntax

**TODO Count:** 9 â†’ 5 (removed Resign, FEN display, PGN display TODOs)

## Current TODO Inventory (5 Total)

**Phase 3 - UI & Display (1 TODO):**
- ScoreView.swift (line 46) - Display game statistics

**Phase 3 - Game Management (4 TODOs):**
- GameMenuView.swift (line 80) - Import FEN action (load .fen files with position navigation + save prompt)
- GameMenuView.swift (line 86) - Import PGN action (load .pgn files with move-by-move navigation + save prompt)
- GameMenuView.swift (line 92) - Share Game action (mid-game sharing via iOS share sheet)
- GameMenuView.swift (line 143) - Save current game to file (Phase 3 - file operations)

## Known Bugs to Fix

**Time Forfeit Alert UI Issue:**
- **Problem:** When time expires, alert shows only "OK" button which clears
  board to starting position and locks the board (can't review final position,
  view PGN/FEN, etc.)
- **Expected Behavior:** Match Resign alert pattern with two buttons:
  - "OK" - Returns to game board for review (board locked, "Start Game"
    disabled, can still view PGN/FEN)
  - "New Game" - Immediately starts fresh game
- **File:** ChessBoardView.swift (time forfeit alert)
- **Priority:** High - UX regression discovered in Session 25

## Agenda for Session 26

**PRIORITY ORDER - Core Features Before Online Features:**

The correct development sequence is to complete ALL core/local features
BEFORE implementing online opponents (Lichess/Chess.com). Online APIs
add network complexity that should only be tackled after the local
foundation is solid and fully tested.

**#1: File Management Features (HIGHEST PRIORITY - Terminal Parity)**
- **Auto-save settings** - Settings toggles for auto-save FEN/PGN on
  game end (matches terminal FENON/FENOFF, PGNON/PGNOFF)
- **Save location picker** - Settings option to choose iCloud Drive vs
  On My iPhone as default save location
- **Auto-save on game end** - Automatically save FEN/PGN when game ends
  (checkmate/stalemate/resignation/draw/time forfeit) if toggles enabled
- **Import FEN with navigation** - Load .fen files with position-by-
  position navigation (terminal LOAD FEN parity)
- **Import PGN with navigation** - Load .pgn files with move-by-move
  navigation (terminal LOAD PGN parity)
- **Share Game feature** - iOS share sheet for mid-game FEN/PGN sharing
  (AirDrop, Messages, Email, Clipboard)
- **Manual save** - Save current game to file via iOS document picker

**#2: Time Forfeit UI Fix**
- Match Resign alert pattern (OK vs New Game buttons)
- OK returns to board for review, New Game starts fresh

**#3: Opening Library Integration**
- Load 24 validated FEN files from terminal project
- Browse and select openings for study/practice

**#4: Game Statistics Display**
- ScoreView enhancements: move count, capture count, time elapsed

**THEN: Online Opponents (Phase 3 - Later)**
- Lichess API integration
- Chess.com API integration
- Multi-engine testing with all 4 opponents

**Rationale:** File operations are core functionality needed regardless
of opponent type. Users need to save/load games whether playing against
Stockfish offline or online opponents. Complete local features first,
then add network complexity.

## Technical Context

**Key Architecture:**
- SwiftUI with MVVM pattern
- ChessEngine protocol for multi-engine support (Stockfish implemented)
- @Published properties for reactive UI updates
- @AppStorage for persistence (board theme, settings, time controls)
- Custom alert overlays using ZStack + semi-transparent backgrounds
- Cburnett SVG chess pieces from Wikimedia Commons

**Recent Technical Decisions:**
- PGN standard FEN headers (`[SetUp "1"]` and `[FEN "..."]`) universally supported by chess programs
- Custom alert overlays preferred over standard SwiftUI alerts for better UX
- 1-second confirmation with auto-dismiss for copy actions
- setupFromFEN() must clear all game state (last move, flags, timer) to prevent bugs

**Testing Protocol:**
- User performs all builds and testing
- Zero-warning compilation required
- Test on iPhone simulator (iPhone 14 Pro minimum)
- Verify responsive design across device sizes

## Development Standards Reminder

1. **Zero Warnings** - All code must compile with zero warnings
2. **User Handles Git** - Developer never performs git operations
3. **TODO Management** - Update tracking section immediately when adding/removing TODOs
4. **Documentation Line Length** - 80 characters maximum in .md files
5. **Incremental Development** - Test after every significant change

## Questions for User

1. Ready to tackle File Management features (highest priority)?
2. Any bugs or issues discovered since last session?
3. Any questions about file save locations (iCloud vs On Device)?
