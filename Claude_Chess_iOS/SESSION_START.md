**Session 18: Oct 17, 2025** - Position Evaluation & Hint System Complete
- Priority 1: Position Evaluation Display (3 formats: centipawns, scaled,
  win probability)
- Priority 2: Hint System Implementation (UCI formatting, 4-state UI)
- Quick fixes: Haptic on AI moves, Integration Tests moved, ChessKitEngine
  license added
- TODO count: 12 â†’ 9

**Session 17: Oct 16, 2025** - AI Gameplay Complete
- Board flipping, Human vs Human mode
- Opponent/skill locking after game starts
- Board move locking until Start Game tapped
- AI engine initialization bug fix (CRITICAL)
- Skill level depth mapping (0-20 â†’ depth 1-15)

## Current Priorities

**Next Up:**
1. **File Management System** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - FEN/PGN import with position navigation
   - Share Game feature (iOS share sheet)
   - Auto-save system with toggles

2. **Game Statistics Display** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Move count display in ScoreView
   - Captured pieces already done (Session 14)
   - Time remaining already done (Session 15)

3. **Resign Functionality** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Implement in both GameMenuView and QuickGameMenuView
   - Game-ending alert with winner announcement

## Known Issues

**RESOLVED (Session 19):**
- âœ… Human allowed to move during AI turn
- âœ… AI making two moves on same turn
- âœ… AI timeout on promotion/castling positions
- âœ… Human promotion picker appearing for AI moves
- âœ… Missing captured pieces after Setup Board
- âœ… Timer continuing after Setup Board
- âœ… No Save Current Game? prompt before Setup Board

**NONE CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING**

## Phase Completion Status

**âœ… Phase 1 COMPLETE** (Oct 9, 2025)

- âœ… Time controls enforcement (Session 15)
- âœ… Stockfish engine integration (Session 16)
- âœ… AI move automation (Session 17)
- âœ… Position evaluation & hints (Session 18)
- âœ… Critical AI gameplay bugs fixed (Session 19)
- ðŸ“‹ Game statistics display
- ðŸ“‹ File management (import/export/share)

## Key Project Files

**Models:**
- `ChessGame.swift` - Game state, engine integration, hint/evaluation
- `StockfishEngine.swift` - UCI protocol, depth mapping, singleton pattern
- `MoveValidator.swift` - Move validation
- `GameStateChecker.swift` - Check/checkmate/stalemate

**Views:**
- `ContentView.swift` - Main UI with board, time, captured pieces
- `ChessBoardView.swift` - 8x8 board with drag-and-drop
- `HintView.swift` - 4-state hint UI
- `ScoreView.swift` - Position evaluation display
- `QuickGameMenuView.swift` - Quick actions (Start Game, Flip Board, Hint)
- `GameMenuView.swift` - Setup Board, Import/Share (placeholders)

## Essential Standards

1. **Zero Warnings** - All code must compile cleanly
2. **TODO Management** - Remove TODOs when features complete, update
   inventory immediately
3. **Documentation** - Update CLAUDE.md and README.md after major features
4. **Testing** - Verify in simulator AND physical device after AI changes
5. **User Handles Git** - Never perform git operations

## Terminal Project Reference

**Location:** `../CLAUDE.md` (parent directory)
**Use When:** Implementing features to verify behavior matches terminal version
**Don't Read:** Unless actively implementing feature requiring terminal parity

## Quick Commands

**TODO Scan:**
```bash
grep -r "TODO" Claude_Chess/Claude_Chess/ --include="*.swift" | wc -l
```

**Recent Commits:**
```bash
git log -3 --format="%h %s%n%b"
```

**Build Project:**
```bash
xcodebuild -project Claude_Chess/Claude_Chess.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Claude_Chess -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

*Condensed session starter - Read full CLAUDE.md only when needed*

Next Session Workflow:
 1. Read SESSION_START.md (~180 lines vs 1700+) (this document)
 2. Run git log -5 to see recent commits
 3. Start working immediately
 4. THIS IS HIGHEST PRIORITY BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE:  The Stockfish AI seems to be taking
    way too much time to make it's moves.  For example at Skill Level 0 with me making
    an opening move of e2e4 the Stockfish AI should come back almost instantly with it's
    move but it isn't.  It's even worse at Skill Level 5 and I haven't even dared to try
    skill level 20.  You had started investigating this and found a 200ms delay that you
    had put in (I can't remember where) for debugging purposes that was still in the code
    but this STILL wasn't/isn't the main cause of the AI Engine taking too long.  We need
    to CAREFULLY investigate this issue and then PROPERLY RESOLVE IT..not 'patch' it.
