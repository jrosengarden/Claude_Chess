# Session 31-32 Status - Board Flip Fix + Threefold Repetition

**Date:** October 29-30, 2025
**Status:**
- ‚úÖ Board Flip Coordinate System - COMPLETE (Session 31)
- üî¥ Threefold Repetition - STILL INCOMPLETE (Session 32: concurrent evaluation bug remains)

## COMPLETED: Board Flip Coordinate System Fix (Session 31 Part 1)

**Problem:** Coordinate labels appearing on wrong edges when board flipped
- Before: Labels on TOP and RIGHT when flipped (double transformation issue)
- After: Labels stay on LEFT and BOTTOM always (correct behavior)

**Root Cause:** Entire container (board + labels) was being rotated 180¬∞
- Coordinate labels were part of rotated view
- Labels ended up on opposite edges after rotation

**Solution:** Separated board rotation from label positioning
- Only the 8x8 chess board grid rotates 180¬∞ when flipped
- Coordinate labels stay in fixed positions (left edge and bottom edge)
- Label content order reverses when flipped (8-1 becomes 1-8, a-h becomes h-a)
- Labels maintain absolute chess coordinates regardless of board orientation

**Implementation Details (ChessBoardView.swift):**
- Moved `.rotationEffect()` from entire container to board grid only
- Rank labels: `boardFlipped ? (row + 1) : (8 - row)` for reversed order
- File labels: `boardFlipped ? (104 - col) : (97 + col)` for reversed order
- Labels always stay on LEFT (ranks) and BOTTOM (files) edges

**PGN Notation Verified:** Already correct, always uses absolute coordinates
- Position.swift `algebraic` property independent of board flip
- MoveRecord.swift notation generation uses Position.algebraic
- No references to boardFlipped in move recording logic

**Result:** Professional board flip matching Shredder iOS reference app
- Unflipped: LEFT = 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1, BOTTOM = a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h
- Flipped: LEFT = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, BOTTOM = h,g,f,e,d,c,b,a
- Board pieces rotate, labels stay on same edges with reversed order
- All move input/output uses absolute coordinates (e2e4 always means e2e4)

**Files Modified:** ChessBoardView.swift (restructured layout, fixed coordinate system)

## INCOMPLETE: Threefold Repetition Implementation (Session 31-32)

### Session 32 Progress (Oct 30, 2025)

**Major fixes completed:**
1. ‚úÖ Fixed alert tracking to use position WITHOUT active player color
2. ‚úÖ Human vs AI: Human gets max 1 alert per unique position
3. ‚úÖ Human vs Human: Each player gets max 1 alert per unique position (2 total)
4. ‚úÖ AI evaluates every threefold occurrence (equality with human's button)
5. ‚úÖ "Claim Draw" button now shows proper ThreefoldDrawResultAlertView
6. ‚úÖ 1-second minimum AI move time implemented system-wide
7. ‚úÖ Spinner overlay shows during AI threefold evaluation (with "Evaluating draw claim..." text)
8. ‚úÖ AI evaluation is "on the clock" (timer keeps running during AI's thinking)
9. ‚úÖ Removed temporary AI override code

### CRITICAL BUG STILL UNRESOLVED

**Symptom:** Duplicate threefold alerts appearing
- First alert appears instantly with brief spinner flash
- User taps OK, returns to board
- 3-5 seconds later, second identical alert appears (no spinner during wait)

**Root Cause:** TWO concurrent calls to `handleAIThreefoldRepetition()` within microseconds
- Console log evidence from iPhone 17 Pro Simulator:
  ```
  2025-10-30 13:43:22.765707 handleAIThreefoldRepetition() started
  2025-10-30 13:43:22.765792 handleAIThreefoldRepetition() started (85 microseconds later!)
  ```
- First evaluation completes in 167ms ‚Üí shows first alert
- Second evaluation completes 20 seconds later ‚Üí shows duplicate alert
- Both evaluations appear to run to completion despite guards

**Attempted Fix (FAILED):** Added guard checking `!game.evaluatingThreefoldClaim`
- Guard placed at line 1095 in ChessBoardView.swift
- Flag set at line 1103 BEFORE Task starts
- Guard still not preventing second concurrent call from proceeding
- Second call likely slipping through before flag gets set (race condition at Task boundary)

## Code Changes Made (Sessions 31-32)

### Session 31 Changes (Board Flip)
**ChessBoardView.swift:**
- Restructured layout to separate board rotation from coordinate labels
- Fixed coordinate system so labels stay on LEFT and BOTTOM edges always

### Session 32 Changes (Threefold Repetition)

**ChessGame.swift (Model):**
1. ‚úÖ Added `evaluatingThreefoldClaim: Bool` - @Published flag for spinner and concurrent guard
2. ‚úÖ Created `generateAlertTrackingKey()` - position key WITHOUT active player color (lines 990-1043)
3. ‚úÖ Updated `checkThreefoldRepetition()` - opponent type checking for alert limits (lines 1045-1097)
4. ‚úÖ Updated `handleAIThreefoldRepetition()` - spinner control with MainActor (lines 1134-1201)
5. ‚úÖ Removed temporary AI override code (clean)

**Key insight on alert tracking:**
- Alert tracking uses position WITHOUT active player (generateAlertTrackingKey)
- Each UNIQUE board snapshot gets its own alert counter
- Position 1 (Queen f7/King h8) and Position 2 (Queen f8/King h7) are DIFFERENT positions
- Each gets its own 1-alert limit (Human vs AI) or 2-alert limit (Human vs Human)

**ChessBoardView.swift (View):**
1. ‚úÖ Added spinner overlay for AI threefold evaluation (lines 478-496)
2. ‚úÖ Added `.onChange(of: game.threefoldDrawClaimed)` watcher for "Claim Draw" button (lines 221-226)
3. ‚úÖ Updated `triggerAIMove()` with 1-second minimum timing (lines 967-991)
4. ‚úÖ Updated threefold handling to keep timer running during AI evaluation (lines 1092-1136)
5. ‚úÖ Added concurrent evaluation guard at line 1095 (FAILED to prevent duplicates)
6. ‚úÖ Set `evaluatingThreefoldClaim = true` at line 1103 BEFORE Task starts (STILL FAILING)

**QuickGameMenuView.swift:**
1. ‚úÖ Updated "Claim Draw" button comment to clarify it shows ThreefoldDrawResultAlertView (line 145)

**Code Cleanup (Session 32):**
1. ‚úÖ Removed temporary AI override code that was returning early
2. ‚úÖ Fixed Character to String conversion in generateAlertTrackingKey
3. ‚úÖ Added explicit return statements to avoid unreachable code warnings

## Known Issues (Session 32)

### CRITICAL BUG - Concurrent Threefold Evaluations
**Status:** UNRESOLVED after Session 32 (out of session resources)

**Problem:** Two concurrent evaluations happen within 85 microseconds
- checkGameEnd() being called twice in rapid succession
- Both calls enter AI threefold evaluation block
- Guard checking `!game.evaluatingThreefoldClaim` not preventing second call
- Second call completes 20 seconds after first, shows duplicate alert

**Why guards are failing:**
- Flag is set BEFORE Task starts (line 1103)
- But both calls check the guard (line 1095) before either sets the flag
- Race condition at synchronous/asynchronous boundary
- Need different approach - perhaps single-use flag or debouncing

### User Concerns About Code Quality

**User is VERY worried about "house of cards" code:**
- Multiple debugging iterations leaving dangling code
- Potentially unused variables or incomplete cleanup
- Guards that may be redundant or incorrectly placed
- Overall code stability from extended debugging sessions

**Post-completion audit required:**
- Search for all `threefold*` references
- Verify no dead code remains
- Check for redundant guards
- Remove all debug NSLog statements
- Document final architecture

## Working Correctly (Session 32)

### ‚úÖ Alert Tracking System
- generateAlertTrackingKey() excludes active player color
- Each unique board snapshot gets separate alert counter
- Human vs AI: 1 alert per position
- Human vs Human: 2 alerts per position (one per player)
- Alert limits respected correctly

### ‚úÖ UI Components Working
- "Claim Draw" button shows ThreefoldDrawResultAlertView correctly
- Spinner overlay displays (but too briefly due to concurrent bug)
- "Evaluating draw claim..." text shows
- All alerts styled properly with custom overlays

### ‚úÖ Chess Logic Working
- Position key generation (pieces + castling + en passant)
- Threefold detection (3+ repetitions)
- AI decision logic (skill-aware thresholds)
- AI evaluates every threefold (equality with human button)
- Human gets alert with "Continue Playing" / "Claim Draw" choice

### ‚úÖ Timer Management
- 1-second minimum AI move time implemented system-wide
- AI threefold evaluation is "on the clock" (timer keeps running)
- Timer stops only if AI claims draw, not during evaluation

## Testing Scenario

**FEN String:** `5Q2/7k/8/5PPP/8/8/8/6K1 w - - 0 0`
- Black king can only move h8‚Üîh7
- White queen moves f8‚Üîf7
- Repeats quickly for threefold testing

**Move sequence that triggers threefold:**
1. f8f7 h7h8
2. f7f8 h8h7
3. f8f7 h7h8
4. f7f8 h8h7
5. f8f7 h7h8 ‚Üê **3rd repetition, alert triggers**

**Expected behavior:**
1. White moves Qf7 ‚Üí 3rd repetition
2. Threefold alert shows
3. **AI should NOT move until alert dismissed**
4. User clicks "Continue Playing"
5. THEN AI moves

**Actual behavior:**
1. White moves Qf7 ‚Üí 3rd repetition
2. Threefold alert shows
3. **AI immediately moves (visible through alert)** ‚ùå
4. Alert still showing after AI moved

## Next Session TODO (Session 33)

### PRIORITY 1: Fix Concurrent Evaluation Bug

**Investigate root cause:**
1. Why is checkGameEnd() being called twice within 85 microseconds?
2. Add NSLog at checkGameEnd() entry to see call frequency
3. Identify which code paths trigger the duplicate calls

**Possible solutions to try:**
1. **Debouncing**: Ignore checkGameEnd() calls within 100ms of last call
2. **Actor isolation**: Move threefold evaluation to @MainActor isolated function
3. **Single-use flag**: Use boolean that gets set permanently until game state changes
4. **Early return**: Check threefoldAlertShowing at checkGameEnd() entry (before threefold check)
5. **Task cancellation**: Cancel any existing threefold evaluation Task before starting new one

### PRIORITY 2: Code Audit (Once Bug Fixed)

**Cleanup tasks:**
1. Remove ALL debug NSLog statements
2. Search for all `threefold*` references - verify each is necessary
3. Verify no unused variables (evaluatingThreefoldClaim used for both spinner and guard)
4. Check for redundant guards
5. Document final architecture in comments

### PRIORITY 3: Full System Testing

**Test scenarios:**
- Human vs Human (both players get alerts for same position)
- Human vs AI (human gets 1 alert, AI evaluates every time)
- "Claim Draw" button (shows ThreefoldDrawResultAlertView)
- State clearing on New Game/Setup Board/Undo
- Multiple unique threefold positions in same game

### PRIORITY 4: Return to SESSION_START.md Agenda

Once threefold is complete, verified, and audited, return to planned features.

## Files Modified (Sessions 31-32)

**Session 31 - Board Flip Fix:**
1. `ChessBoardView.swift` - Coordinate system restructure (complete)

**Session 32 - Threefold Repetition:**
2. `ChessGame.swift` - Added evaluatingThreefoldClaim flag, generateAlertTrackingKey(), updated checkThreefoldRepetition() with opponent type checking, updated handleAIThreefoldRepetition() with spinner control
3. `ChessBoardView.swift` - Added spinner overlay, onChange watcher for Claim Draw, 1-second minimum AI timing, concurrent evaluation guard (FAILING)
4. `QuickGameMenuView.swift` - Updated comment for Claim Draw button

**Documentation (Sessions 31-32):**
5. `THREEFOLD_STATUS.md` - This file (updated with Session 32 progress and remaining bug)

## Session Resource Warning

**Session 31:** ~3% remaining after board flip fix and initial threefold work
**Session 32:** ~9% remaining after extensive threefold debugging

Sessions 31-32 consumed significantly more resources than expected due to:
1. ‚úÖ Board flip coordinate fix (completed Session 31)
2. üî¥ Threefold repetition concurrent evaluation bug (still unresolved after Session 32)
3. üî¥ Multiple failed approaches to guard concurrent async Tasks
4. üî¥ User frustration with premature coding and "house of cards" concerns

**Status:** Feature ~95% complete but blocked by critical concurrent evaluation bug.
Will export conversation and resume Session 33.

## SESSION_START.md Context

Threefold repetition was the #1 priority in SESSION_START.md (Session 27 agenda).

**Other SESSION_START.md priorities still pending:**
- File Management Features (auto-save, import FEN/PGN, share)
- Opening Library Integration
- Game Statistics Display
- Online Opponents (Lichess/Chess.com)

**Once threefold is complete and audited**, return to SESSION_START.md agenda.

---

## Summary for Next Session (Session 33)

**What works:**
- Alert tracking per unique position (excludes active player)
- Human vs AI alert limits (1 per position)
- Human vs Human alert limits (2 per position)
- AI evaluates every threefold (equality with human)
- Spinner overlay displays
- Timer runs during AI evaluation
- 1-second minimum AI move time

**What's broken:**
- Two concurrent evaluations within 85 microseconds
- Guard not preventing second evaluation
- Duplicate alert after 20 seconds
- Spinner appears too briefly (first eval completes in 167ms)

**Next steps:**
1. Investigate why checkGameEnd() called twice
2. Try debouncing or other concurrency control
3. Remove all debug NSLog statements
4. Comprehensive code audit
5. Full system testing

**CRITICAL:** Feature ~95% complete but blocked by concurrent evaluation bug. Must resolve before moving to other SESSION_START.md priorities.


  ## USER NOTE: Post-Fix Code Audit Requirement
    After a multi-session debugging marathon like this, a comprehensive code audit is mandatory, not optional. Here's
  why:

  Evidence from Session 32 alone:
  - Temporary override code that needed removal
  - Character to String conversion bug (dangling from earlier attempt)
  - Multiple guard attempts that didn't work but might still be in code
  - Debug NSLog statements throughout multiple files
  - Flag variables added for different approaches

  What the audit needs to find:
  1. Unused variables - Did we add flags that aren't being used anymore?
  2. Redundant guards - Multiple guard attempts, are all still needed?
  3. Dead code paths - Logic that never executes
  4. Debug logging - All NSLog statements that need removal
  5. Commented-out code - Failed approaches we left behind
  6. Inconsistent patterns - Where we tried different approaches in different places

  Audit timing:
  - AFTER the concurrent bug is fixed and tested
  - BEFORE marking threefold complete
  - BEFORE moving to next SESSION_START.md feature

  Suggested audit process:
  1. Search entire codebase for "threefold" - review every reference
  2. Search for "NSLog" - remove all debug statements
  3. Review ChessGame.swift properties - verify each is used
  4. Review ChessBoardView.swift guards - verify each is necessary
  5. Build with zero warnings
  6. Run comprehensive tests

  Your "house of cards" concern is 100% valid after this kind of extended debugging. The audit will restore
  confidence in code quality.
