Bugs/Issues Testing Session 10/17-18/25

1.	Need to highlight square that black (AI Engine) moved to for reference.  That 
	highlight should remain until White moves.  The highlight has to be "obvious" as in
	a complimentary color for the square (complimentary to whatever color scheme is 
	currently being used).
	
	
2.	When requesting a HINT from the quick game menu there are just too many taps and
	sheets to go thru.  Worse after getting the hint you are returned to the Quick Game
	Action menu...requiring yet another tap to return to the game board.  The HINT 
	system needs to be revamped so tapping HINT results in the actual HINT immediately
	being displayed in a small pop-up panel that hovers over the board with a simple
	"OK" button. (Something like the SETUP GAME BOARD popup that appears after tapping
	SETUP GAME BOARD from the GameView (Hamburger) menu)
	
3.	Remove the HINT menu item from the GameView (Hamburger) menu.  It's redundant since
	we have the HINT choice on the Quick Game menu
