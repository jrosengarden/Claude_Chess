# Session 18 Agenda - AI Enhancements & File Management

## Status Check
- Review any issues discovered during user testing since Session 17
- Verify AI gameplay working correctly across different skill levels
- Check for any performance issues or bugs

## Quick Bug (Oversight) Fixes:
-	Stockfish not using haptic feedback when making it's move
-	Getting some test failures on the Stockfish Integration Tests on the physical
	iPhone 14 Pro.  Typically Test #3, #4 & #5 are showing "failed" but this
	behavior is not replicated on the iPhone 17 Pro Sim or the iPad Pro M4 Sim.
	All 3 failed tests show "Engine Response Timeout"
-	Move Stockfish Integration Test from Quick Menu to Stockfish Opponent View
	- Maybe we'll keep this here even for the production release? Opinion??
- 	Remove About/Version from Settings View.  It's redundant as there is an 
	"About" on the Hamburger menu.
-	Do we need to add any license attribution for the ChessKitEngine v0.7.0?
	If so it'll need to be added to the "Third Party Licenses" section on the
	Hamburger menu "About" menu choice.

## Priority 0: Stockfish Version Verification (5 minutes)
**Goal:** Confirm ChessKitEngine v0.7.0 is bundling Stockfish 17

**CRITICAL for App Store marketing** - We need to know exact version we're
shipping!

**Tasks:**
- Add `getEngineVersion()` method to StockfishEngine.swift
- Parse UCI "id name" response during initialization
- Add Test 7 to EngineTest.swift: "Verify Stockfish Version"
- Display version in test results (e.g., "âœ… Stockfish Version: Stockfish 17")
- Add Stockfish version to AboutView for users to see
- Update app marketing copy with confirmed version

**Implementation Notes:**
- UCI protocol sends "id name Stockfish XX" automatically during uci command
- Capture during initialize() and store in engineName property
- Display in About view: "Powered by Stockfish 17" (or whatever version confirmed)

**Why This Matters:**
- App Store listing accuracy ("Stockfish 17 included")
- User trust (they can verify version themselves in About)
- Future updates (know when to update package for SF18)

## Priority 1: Position Evaluation Display
**Goal:** Show Stockfish's position evaluation on screen (like terminal project)

**Tasks:**
- Implement `evaluatePosition()` in StockfishEngine.swift
- Add UCI "eval" command support
- Update ScoreView.swift to display live evaluation
- Support all 3 formats: Centipawns, Scaled (-9 to +9), Win Probability
- Test evaluation updates after each move
- Remove TODO from ScoreView.swift (line 21)

**Terminal Reference:** `../CLAUDE.md` - get_position_evaluation() and
centipawns_to_scale()

**UI Implementation:**
- Replace "Position Evaluation will appear here" placeholder text
- Display format examples:
  - Centipawns: "+1.2" (White ahead by 1.2 pawns)
  - Scaled: "+3" (moderate White advantage on -9 to +9 scale)
  - Win Probability: "65%" (White has 65% chance to win)
- Updates live after each move (human and AI)

## Priority 2: Hint System Implementation
**Goal:** Allow user to request move suggestions from Stockfish

**Tasks:**
- Implement `getHint()` in StockfishEngine.swift using fast depth-based
  search
- Update HintView.swift with hint display UI
- Show suggested move on board (highlight from/to squares?)
- Add "thinking" indicator while hint calculates
- Test hint doesn't consume user's time
- Remove TODO from HintView.swift (line 36)

**Terminal Reference:** `../CLAUDE.md` - get_hint_move() with depth-based
search

## Priority 3: Game Statistics Display
**Goal:** Display game statistics in tappable popover (like captured pieces)

**Tasks:**
- Update ScoreView.swift "Game Statistics" row to be tappable
- Implement `.popover()` modifier showing floating window
- Display statistics:
  - Move Count: [fullmove number from FEN]
  - Halfmove Clock: [moves since last pawn/capture]
  - Captured by White: [piece list with counts]
  - Captured by Black: [piece list with counts]
  - Time Elapsed: [MM:SS if time controls enabled]
- Test popover on iPhone (centered) and iPad (arrow pointing to source)
- Popover dismisses when user taps outside
- Remove TODO from ScoreView.swift (line 29)

**UI Style:**
- Similar to captured pieces tappable overlay system (Session 14)
- Compact, readable format in floating window
- Automatic positioning based on device

## Priority 4: AI Time Integration (if time permits)
**Goal:** Make Stockfish use time controls when enabled

**Tasks:**
- Update StockfishEngine.getBestMove() to use time-based search when time
  controls enabled
- Calculate AI thinking time (1/20th of remaining time, min 500ms, max 10s)
- Test time deduction after AI moves
- Verify AI doesn't exceed time limits

**Terminal Reference:** `../CLAUDE.md` - Time Controls System section

## Known Issues to Address
- (User to fill in any issues discovered during testing)

## Future Sessions (Not This Session)
These features will be covered in Session 19+:
- FEN/PGN import with position navigation (LOAD FEN/PGN terminal parity)
- Auto-save system (FEN/PGN toggles in Settings)
- Share Game feature (iOS share sheet)
- Resign functionality
- "Save current game" prompts before loading positions
- PGN generation with move history
- Algebraic notation converter (for PGN output)

## Documentation Tasks (End of Session)
- Update Session 18 entry in CLAUDE.md
- Update Readme.md with appropriate information from Session 18
- Update Implementation Progress (mark completed items)
- Update TODO tracking (remove completed TODOs)
- Verify TODO count accuracy with grep
- Generate commit message

## Notes
- Terminal project CLAUDE.md is authoritative reference for all
  implementations
- Maintain zero-warning compilation
- Test each feature before marking complete
- Follow 80-char line length in documentation
