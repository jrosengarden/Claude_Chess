## Development Standards (Inherited from Terminal Project)

### Mandatory Standards from Terminal Project

These standards are **NON-NEGOTIABLE** and carry over from the
terminal project:

1. **Documentation Line Length**: 80 characters maximum per line
   in ALL .md files
2. **Zero Warnings**: All code must compile with zero warnings
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: All features must have tests before
   completion
4. **Incremental Development**: Test after every significant change
5. **Professional Documentation**: All code fully documented with
   parameter descriptions
6. **No Session Crashes**: Never run full games during development
   sessions
7. **User Handles Git**: Developer never performs git operations
8. **TODO Management**: Actively monitor and remove TODO comments
   when functionality is implemented. Before marking any feature
   complete, search for related TODOs and remove them. See TODO
   Tracking section below for current inventory.

### Standards NOT Inherited (iOS-Specific Simplifications)

1. **Multi-Platform Testing**: Terminal project required testing on
   macOS, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi. iOS project targets single
   Apple ecosystem (iOS/iPadOS/macOS) via unified SwiftUI. Testing
   on iPhone Simulator validates all Apple platforms.

### iOS-Specific Additional Standards

1. **SwiftUI Best Practices** - Modern declarative UI patterns
2. **MVVM Architecture** - Clear separation of concerns
3. **Accessibility First** - VoiceOver support for all features
4. **60fps Performance** - Smooth animations, efficient updates
5. **Swift API Guidelines** - Follow Apple's naming conventions

### Documentation Standards (Critical - Prevent Doc Sprawl)

**Lessons Learned from Terminal Project:**
The terminal project's CLAUDE.md grew to ~1400 lines with significant
redundancy requiring multiple refactoring sessions. iOS project
standards prevent this issue.

**Mandatory Documentation Practices:**

1. **Session History - Stay Concise**
   - Focus on KEY DECISIONS and ARCHITECTURE CHOICES only
   - Do NOT document every code change or file modification
   - Keep entries to 3-5 bullet points maximum per session
   - Bad: "Updated line 47 in FileX.swift to fix typo"
   - Good: "Implemented custom color picker with live preview"

2. **No Duplicate Feature Documentation**
   - Document each feature ONCE in its logical section
   - "Latest Progress" and "Implementation Progress" must stay
     synchronized
   - Do NOT replicate architecture details across sections
   - Cross-reference with "See Section X" when needed

3. **Implementation Progress Section**
   - Keep completed items as brief bullet points
   - Do NOT expand with implementation details (those go in
     dedicated sections)
   - Update status (‚úÖ/üîÑ/üìã) without expanding text unnecessarily

4. **Avoid "Recently Completed" Lists**
   - Terminal project suffered from ever-growing "Recently
     Completed" sections
   - Move completed items to appropriate permanent sections
   - Session History captures temporal progression

5. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Document new systems ONCE in dedicated subsection
   - Example: "Board Color Theme System" documents entire feature
   - Do NOT repeat details in Session History or Implementation
     Progress

**Review Checkpoints:**
- Every 3-4 sessions: Scan for redundancy
- Before Phase transitions: Consolidate documentation
- Flag if CLAUDE.md approaches 1000+ lines

**Current Status:** ~900 lines (healthy), no redundancy detected

### Code Style
- Swift API Design Guidelines compliance
- Clear, self-documenting function names
- Comprehensive inline comments for complex logic
- Organized file structure with clear module boundaries

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for chess logic (move validation, game rules)
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for board rendering
- Integration tests for AI opponent

### TODO Tracking System

**Purpose:** Monitor in-code TODO comments to ensure completion and
prevent accumulation of technical debt.

**Current TODO Inventory (5 total as of Oct 23, 2025 - Session 26):**

**Phase 3 - Move Validation & Game Logic (0 TODOs):**
- ‚úÖ All validation complete (2 castling TODOs removed in Session 15 post-session fixes)

**Phase 3 - UI & Display (1 TODO):**
- `ScoreView.swift` (line 58) - Display game statistics

**Phase 3 - Game Management (4 TODOs):**
- `GameMenuView.swift` (line 80) - Import FEN action (load .fen files with position navigation + save prompt)
- `GameMenuView.swift` (line 86) - Import PGN action (load .pgn files with move-by-move navigation + save prompt)
- `GameMenuView.swift` (line 92) - Share Game action (mid-game sharing via iOS share sheet)
- `GameMenuView.swift` (line 143) - Save current game to file (Setup Board Phase 3 placeholder)

**Future/Optional (0 TODOs):**
- ‚úÖ All optional TODOs removed

**Changes in Session 26:**
- No TODO additions or removals - inventory remains stable at 5 TODOs
- Updated line numbers after code changes

**Changes in Session 23:**
- Removed 4 TODOs: Resign (completed in QuickGameMenuView), FEN display (completed), PGN display (completed)
- Total reduced from 9 to 5 TODOs

**Active Maintenance Protocol (MANDATORY):**

**When ADDING a TODO to code:**
1. Add the TODO comment to the code file
2. IMMEDIATELY update this TODO Tracking section
3. Categorize by phase (Phase 2/3/Future)
4. Update the total count at top of inventory

**When REMOVING a TODO from code:**
1. Remove the TODO comment from the code file
2. IMMEDIATELY remove from this TODO Tracking section
3. Update the total count at top of inventory
4. Mention removal in Session History if feature-significant

**Before marking ANY feature complete:**
1. Search: `grep -r "TODO" . | grep [feature_name]`
2. Remove ALL related TODOs from code
3. Remove ALL related TODOs from this tracking section
4. Verify with second grep search
5. Update total count

**Weekly audit during active development:**
- Run: `grep -r "TODO" Claude_Chess/Claude_Chess/` to verify
- Check for orphaned TODOs not in this tracking system
- Check for tracking entries without corresponding code TODOs
- Update inventory immediately if discrepancies found

**This tracking system is USELESS unless actively maintained!**

## Multi-Engine AI Architecture

### Design Decision: Flexible Engine Selection

**Approved Architecture:** Protocol-based multi-engine system allowing
users to select their preferred AI opponent for each game session.

**Supported Engines:**
1. **Stockfish (Native)** - Offline play, UCI protocol, skill 0-20
2. **Lichess API** - Online play, cloud analysis, rating ~800-2800
3. **Chess.com API** - Online play, multiple skill levels

### Implementation Strategy: Protocol Pattern

```swift
// Core protocol defining chess engine behavior
protocol ChessEngine {
    func getBestMove(position: String, skillLevel: Int) async -> Move?
    func getHint(position: String) async -> Move?
    func evaluatePosition(position: String) async -> Int?
    func setSkillLevel(_ level: Int)
    var engineName: String { get }
    var requiresInternet: Bool { get }
}

// Three concrete implementations
class StockfishEngine: ChessEngine {
    // UCI protocol communication (terminal project parity)
}

class LichessEngine: ChessEngine {
    // REST/WebSocket API integration
}

class ChessComEngine: ChessEngine {
    // REST API integration
}

// Game uses selected engine
class ChessGame {
    var currentEngine: ChessEngine
    // All AI requests go through protocol methods
}
```

### User Experience

**Engine Selection UI:**
```
Settings ‚Üí Opponent Selection
  ‚óã Stockfish (Offline, Skill 0-20)
  ‚óã Lichess (Online, Rating 800-2800)
  ‚óã Chess.com (Online, Beginner-Master)
```

**Per-Game Configuration:** Engine preference saved with each game,
not globally. Allows flexibility:
- Casual offline game ‚Üí Stockfish level 5
- Serious study ‚Üí Lichess 2000 rating
- Tournament prep ‚Üí Chess.com Master

### Phased Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Stockfish Native Integration (MVP)**
- Status: **PRIMARY FOCUS** for initial release
- Compile Stockfish as iOS framework/library
- Implement UCI protocol communication (terminal project parity)
- Establish ChessEngine protocol architecture
- Complete offline play capability
- Validate all chess logic ports correctly
- **Goal:** Feature parity with terminal version

**Phase 2: Lichess API Integration**
- Status: **POST-MVP ENHANCEMENT**
- Implement LichessEngine conforming to protocol
- Add OAuth authentication for user accounts
- Integrate opening explorer and cloud analysis
- Handle network connectivity and error cases
- Add engine selection UI
- **Goal:** Online play and cloud features

**Phase 3: Chess.com API Integration**
- Status: **FUTURE ENHANCEMENT**
- Implement ChessComEngine conforming to protocol
- Complete three-engine comparison features
- Polish UI for multi-engine system
- Add engine performance analytics
- **Goal:** Maximum flexibility and choice

### Technical Considerations

**Advantages:**
- Clean separation via protocol-based design
- Engine-agnostic chess logic (already true from C port)
- User flexibility for different play styles
- Offline capability maintained (Stockfish)
- Online features available when desired (APIs)

**Challenges:**
- API rate limits (Lichess/Chess.com usage restrictions)
- Skill level mapping (Stockfish 0-20 vs rating systems)
- Network error handling and offline detection
- Testing complexity (need to mock network engines)
- Feature parity (some features engine-specific)

**Mitigation:**
- Phased implementation manages complexity
- Protocol abstraction isolates engine differences
- Graceful degradation for network failures
- Comprehensive unit tests with mocked engines

### Integration Points

**Existing Systems:**
- Chess logic layer remains engine-agnostic
- FEN/PGN handling works with all engines
- Time control system applies to all engines
- Hint system uses same protocol method across engines

**New Requirements:**
- Network connectivity monitoring
- API authentication management (OAuth)
- Engine preference persistence
- Rate limit tracking and throttling

## Technical Advantages

### Code Reusability
- Chess logic algorithms translate directly from C to Swift
- Existing validation and testing patterns applicable
- UCI protocol knowledge directly transferable (if using
  Stockfish)
- File format handling (FEN/PGN) preservable
- All edge cases and bug fixes already documented

### Development Efficiency

play anywhere

**Distribution**: App Store reach and discoverability vs manual
installation

**Cross-Platform**: iOS app runs natively on iPhone, iPad, and
Apple Silicon Macs - significantly wider audience

**User Experience**: Touch gestures, animations, haptic feedback,
modern UI/UX standards

**Features**: Platform-specific enhancements (widgets, iCloud
sync, share, notifications)

**Modernization**: Contemporary design patterns vs terminal
aesthetics

## Data Structures (Swift Translation)

### Core Game Types
```swift
// To be implemented - examples:

enum PieceType {
    case pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, king
}

enum Color {
    case white, black
}

struct Position {
    let row: Int
    let col: Int
}

struct Piece {
    let type: PieceType
    let color: Color
}

struct ChessGame {
    var board: [[Piece?]]
    var currentPlayer: Color
    var whiteKingPos: Position
    var blackKingPos: Position
    // ... additional game state
}
```

  piece movement until "Start Game" button tapped
  - Guards added to handleDragChanged() and handleSingleTap()
- **AI engine initialization bug fix (CRITICAL):** Fixed Stockfish not
  making moves
  - Root cause: Engine wasn't being initialized when "Start Game" tapped
  - Solution: Added initializeEngine() call in QuickGameMenuView "Start Game"
  - Added @AppStorage properties to read selectedEngine and skillLevel
  - Debug logging confirmed proper engine initialization flow

  ChessGame, complete HintView rewrite with formatHintMove() and hintDescription()
  helpers. Fixed hint availability logic: checks game.engine != nil (not opponent
  setting) and game.gameInProgress (prevents hints before "Start Game"). User
  confirmed: "Hint system seems to be working fine."
- **TODO count reduced:** 12 ‚Üí 9 total (removed HintView and ScoreView evaluation
  TODOs)

  900ms‚Üí150ms, polling 100ms‚Üí10ms, stop delay 200ms‚Üí100ms (AI responds much faster)
- **Generation counter system** - Implemented request/response tracking to prevent
  stale bestmove responses (fixed race condition causing double-moves and cached moves)
- **Skill level bug fix** - Changed from variable depth (1-15) to fixed depth 10
  matching terminal project; all skill levels were playing identically due to
  insufficient move diversity at shallow depths
- **Terminal project parity** - Verified UCI "Skill Level" option with fixed depth 10
  matches terminal DEFAULT_SEARCH_DEPTH behavior
- **Debug cleanup** - Removed NSLog statements after race condition resolved
- **User testing** - No double-moves at any skill level, subtle difficulty differences
  visible, fast AI response times maintained
- **TODO count:** 8 ‚Üí 9 (Setup Board save TODO confirmed as correct Phase 3 placeholder)

**Session 21: Oct 18, 2025** - Critical UX Fixes & Last Move Highlighting
- **Fixed checkmate/stalemate alerts** - Now only trigger after "Start Game" tapped,
  not immediately when FEN loaded via Setup Board (ChessBoardView.swift)
- **Fixed captured pieces persistence** - Setup Board captured pieces now persist
  after first move; added initialCapturedByWhite/Black properties (ChessGame.swift)
- **Last move highlighting system** - Added corner triangle markers (black) + semi-
  transparent overlay to show from/to squares; destination=large triangles (25%),
  origin=small triangles (15%); user-toggleable in Settings ‚Üí Board ‚Üí "Highlight
  Last Move" (default ON)
- **Removed redundant HINT** - Deleted from GameMenuView hamburger menu, kept in
  Quick Game Menu only

**Session 22: Oct 19, 2025** - Code Cleanup, UX Polish & Offer Draw Feature

  (Queen endgames, opening positions, equal positions)
- **TODO count:** 9 total (no change)

**Session 23: Oct 19, 2025** - Stockfish Color Selection Feature
- **Stockfish plays color selection** - Added segmented picker in Stockfish
  Settings allowing user to choose which color AI plays (White or Black)
- **Default setting** - Stockfish plays Black (human plays White) matching
  traditional chess setup
- **Immediate board flip** - Board orientation updates instantly when user
  changes color selection (via .onChange modifier)
- **Automatic time control swap** - Time allocations swap when color changes
  so human always gets intended time (White time ‚Üí Black time when playing Black)
- **Game-start lock** - Color selection disabled after game starts (matches
  skill level lock pattern)
- **AI turn logic updates** - ChessGame.isAITurn and isHumanTurn now respect
  selected color (aiColor computed property)
- **2-second delay** - When Stockfish plays White, 2-second delay before
  first move gives user time to return to main view
- **Model updates** - Added stockfishColor parameter to initializeEngine()
  and resetGame() methods
- **Settings integration** - StockfishSettingsView, QuickGameMenuView, and
  GameMenuView all read and pass stockfishPlaysColor setting

  50-Move Rule Draw (handshake icon), Resignation (winner's pawn)
- **FEN display implementation** - Custom alert overlay with horizontal scrolling,
  Copy button with 1-second confirmation auto-dismiss, Cancel button returns to main view
- **PGN display implementation** - Custom alert overlay with move history, Copy button
  with 1-second confirmation, proper game result tracking (1-0, 0-1, 1/2-1/2, *)
- **PGN result fix** - Added checkmateWinner property to distinguish checkmate from draws;
  generatePGN() now checks resignation, then checkmate, then draws for accurate results
- **PGN standard FEN headers** - Added `[SetUp "1"]` and `[FEN "..."]` headers when game
  started from Setup Board (PGN standard for custom positions, universally supported)
- **Setup Board bug fixes** - Fixed persistent last-move indicators and disabled "Start Game"
  button; setupFromFEN() now clears lastMoveFrom/To, gameInProgress, gameHasEnded, and timer state
- **startingFEN tracking** - Added property to store FEN when using Setup Board; cleared on
  New Game (standard position)
- **TODO count:** 9 ‚Üí 5 total (removed Resign, FEN display, PGN display TODOs)

**Session 25: Oct 20, 2025** - Critical Bug Fix: Position Evaluation Consistency
- **Bug discovered:** Draw offer system showing inconsistent behavior - AI declined draw
  when losing badly (+639cp White advantage reported, but evaluation varied wildly on
  subsequent tests: -179cp, -377cp, -627cp for same position at Skill Level 5)
- **Root cause analysis:** Two compounding bugs in evaluation system:
  1. **Skill Level applied to evaluations** - iOS evaluated at configured Skill Level
     (0-20), causing unreliable results at low skills; terminal project always evaluates
     at full strength regardless of play skill
  2. **Random depth capture** - iOS captured evaluation from any depth that happened to
     arrive (depth 3, 7, 10, etc.); terminal project only uses deepest depth (depth 15)
- **Fix 1: Skill Level boost for evaluations** - `StockfishEngine.evaluatePosition()`
  now temporarily sets skill to 20 before evaluation, restores original skill after
  (matches terminal project behavior where evaluations are always full strength)
- **Fix 2: Depth-based filtering** - Added `currentEvaluationDepth` tracking; only
  accepts evaluation scores from deepest depth seen; waits for depth 15 before returning
  (matches terminal `max_depth_seen` logic)
- **Fix 3: Proper wait timing** - Modified while loop condition to wait until
  `currentEvaluationDepth >= 15` before restoring skill level (prevents premature
  skill restoration that was causing evaluations to complete at wrong skill)
- **Testing results:** Evaluations now consistent at -550cp to -620cp (¬±35cp variance
  is normal per terminal project comments), all map to scaled score -8 matching terminal
  app; draw offer correctly declines when AI winning; verified on iPhone 17 Pro simulator
  and iPhone 14 Pro physical device
- **Bug discovered during session:** Time forfeit alert only shows "OK" button which
  clears board; should match Resign pattern with "OK" (return to board for review) and
  "New Game" (immediate reset) - documented in SESSION_START.md for Session 26
- **Files modified:** `StockfishEngine.swift` (evaluation skill boost + depth tracking),
  `ChessGame.swift` (draw offer color handling), `SESSION_START.md` (time forfeit bug)
- **TODO count:** 5 (unchanged)

**Session 26: Oct 23, 2025** - User Guide & Contact Developer Features
- **PDF User Guide viewer** - Implemented in-app PDF viewer using native PDFKit

  - Share button in toolbar for AirDrop, email, save to Files, print
  - Easy updates: replace UserGuide.pdf file and rebuild
- **Contact Developer feature** - Email feedback system with categorization
  - Added "Help & Feedback" section in AboutView (between App Information and Credits)
  - Moved User Guide to new section for logical grouping
  - Action sheet with 3 options: Feedback, Bug Report, Feature Request
  - Uses `mailto:` URL to open user's mail app with pre-filled recipient and subject
  - Email address easily changeable for future Gmail migration
- **AboutView refactoring** - Reorganized structure for better UX
  - New section: "Help & Feedback" containing User Guide and Contact Developer
  - User Guide moved from App Information to new section
  - Professional help/support workflow matching App Store best practices

  - Added `causedCheck` and `causedCheckmate` properties to MoveRecord
  - Detection logic in ChessGame after move execution
  - Updated notation property to append appropriate symbols
- **Evaluation freeze bug SOLVED** - Implemented on-demand evaluation (Occam's Razor victory!)
  - Root cause: Concurrent UCI requests to single Stockfish instance
  - Solution: Evaluation only when user opens ScoreView (`.onAppear` trigger)
  - Removed all automatic evaluation calls from game flow
  - Shows "Evaluating position..." spinner during 3-5 second calculation
  - **End of 4-5 session debugging saga** - simple solution was best all along
- **Time forfeit alert improvements** - Custom overlay matching resign pattern
  - Created TimeForfeitAlertView with winner's pawn icon

  `ContentView.swift`, `ScoreView.swift`, `StockfishEngine.swift`
- **TODO count:** 5 (unchanged)

### Key Decisions

**Oct 1, 2025**: Multi-engine AI architecture approved - Protocol-
based design supporting Stockfish (native), Lichess API, and
Chess.com API with phased implementation (Stockfish Phase 1/MVP,
Lichess Phase 2, Chess.com Phase 3)

**Oct 8, 2025**: Color definition strategy - Used file-level
fileprivate constants with fully-qualified SwiftUI.Color type to
avoid initializer ambiguity issues

**Oct 8, 2025**: Chess piece graphics - Adopted Cburnett SVG assets
from Wikimedia Commons for professional appearance, rejecting Unicode
symbols due to unprofessional "hollow/sketch" appearance of white
pieces

**Oct 8, 2025**: Settings architecture - Implemented extensible
navigation-based settings system early in Phase 1 to establish proper
architecture before Phase 2 complexity. Custom color feature added as
first user customization option with full persistence support.

**Oct 8, 2025**: Header layout - Decided against tab bar approach for
Settings/Game Menu icons. Keeping both as modal sheets accessed from
header maximizes board space and follows iOS conventions for action
menus vs navigation sections.

**Oct 9, 2025**: Dual access patterns - Retained features in both main
view shortcuts (time controls, opponent, hint) AND hamburger menu for
dual discovery mechanisms respecting different user interaction styles.

**Oct 11, 2025**: Phase 2 promotion strategy - Both White AND Black use
the same interactive promotion picker UI for Phase 2 human testing. This
simplifies implementation and provides consistent UX. Phase 3 AI
integration will add conditional logic to distinguish human vs AI
promotion (AI will select piece automatically via UCI notation like
"e7e8q"). Protocol-based ChessEngine architecture ensures clean
refactoring for Stockfish/Lichess/Chess.com engines.

**Oct 16, 2025**: Skill level depth mapping - Stockfish's UCI "Skill
Level" option has limited effect at high search depths. Solution:
calculateSearchDepth(for:) maps skill 0-20 to search depth 1-15 plies,
providing realistic strength variation. Skill 5 = depth 3 (beginner
mistakes), Skill 10 = depth 7 (intermediate play), Skill 20 = depth 15
(maximum strength). This prevents the depth-10-for-all issue that caused
unrealistic AI difficulty. User testing confirmed move quality matches
reference Stockfish 17.1 engine.

### Board Color Theme System

**Architecture Overview:**
Complete color customization system with 6 preset themes plus custom
color picker. Themes persist across app restarts using UserDefaults.

**Theme Model** (`BoardColorTheme.swift`):
```swift
struct BoardColorTheme: Identifiable, Codable, Equatable {
    let id: String
    let name: String
    let lightSquare: ColorComponents
    let darkSquare: ColorComponents
}
```

**Preset Themes**:
1. **Classic** - Traditional tan/brown (default)
2. **Wooden** - Warm amber/dark brown with golden light squares
3. **Blue** - Cool blue tones
4. **Green** - Forest green with light squares
5. **Marble** - Elegant grey/white
6. **Tournament** - High contrast white/dark green
7. **Custom** - User-defined colors via color picker

**Persistence Implementation**:
- Theme selection: `@AppStorage("boardThemeId")`
- Custom colors: 6 separate `@AppStorage` properties for RGB
  components
  - `customLightRed`, `customLightGreen`, `customLightBlue`
  - `customDarkRed`, `customDarkGreen`, `customDarkBlue`
- Values persist in UserDefaults across app kills and device restarts

**Custom Color Picker Features**:
- Live 4x4 chess board preview showing actual color appearance
- Separate ColorPicker controls for light and dark squares
- Real-time preview updates as colors change
- Automatic theme switching to "custom" when colors modified
- RGB component extraction from SwiftUI.Color via UIColor bridge

**Technical Implementation**:
- `BoardColorTheme.componentsFrom(color:)` converts SwiftUI.Color to
  RGB using UIColor
- `BoardColorTheme.theme(withId:customLight:customDark:)` returns
  custom theme with user colors
- ChessBoardView reads both theme ID and custom colors from
  @AppStorage
- Dynamic theme resolution in `currentTheme` computed property

**User Experience Flow**:
1. Tap gear icon in ContentView
2. Navigate to "Board Colors" in SettingsView
3. Select preset theme (immediate preview) OR tap "Custom"
4. Custom picker shows live 4x4 board preview
5. Adjust light/dark square colors independently
6. Return to game - board reflects new colors
7. Colors persist even after app termination

### Chess Piece Assets

**License**: CC-BY-SA 3.0 (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike)
**Creator**: User:Cburnett
**URL**: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_chess_pieces

**Assets Used** (12 SVG files):
- White pieces: `Chess_klt45.svg`, `Chess_qlt45.svg`, `Chess_rlt45.svg`,
  `Chess_blt45.svg`, `Chess_nlt45.svg`, `Chess_plt45.svg`
- Black pieces: `Chess_kdt45.svg`, `Chess_qdt45.svg`, `Chess_rdt45.svg`,
  `Chess_bdt45.svg`, `Chess_ndt45.svg`, `Chess_pdt45.svg`

**File Naming Convention**:
- Format: `Chess_XYZ45.svg`
- X = piece letter (k=king, q=queen, r=rook, b=bishop, n=knight,
  p=pawn)
- Y = color (l=light/white, d=dark/black)
- Z = background (t=transparent)
- 45 = size reference

**Implementation Details**:
- Assets stored in `Assets.xcassets` catalog
- `PieceType.assetName(for:)` method maps pieces to asset names
- `Piece.assetName` property provides convenient access
- ChessBoardView uses `Image()` with `.resizable()` and
  `.aspectRatio()` for proper scaling
- Vector graphics scale perfectly on all iOS devices

**Attribution**: These chess pieces are widely used across Wikipedia,
chess.com (early versions), and numerous chess applications. The
Cburnett style is considered a standard for digital chess
representation.

### Technical Challenges Resolved

**Oct 8, 2025**: SwiftUI Color initializer ambiguity
- **Problem**: Color(red:green:blue:) was being misinterpreted as
  Decodable initializer
- **Solution**: Moved color definitions to file-level constants with
  explicit SwiftUI.Color type qualification
- **Learning**: SwiftUI color initialization in struct properties can
  have type inference issues; file-level constants avoid this

**Oct 8, 2025**: Chess piece visual quality
- **Problem**: Unicode chess symbols (‚ôî‚ôï‚ôñ‚ôó‚ôò‚ôô) rendered with
  unprofessional "hollow/sketch" appearance for white pieces
- **Attempted Solutions**: SF Symbols (not available), solid Unicode
  with white fill (foregroundColor doesn't work on emoji-style glyphs),
  white background circles (visually unappealing)
- **Final Solution**: Professional SVG assets from Wikimedia Commons
  (Cburnett pieces)
- **Result**: App Store-quality graphics matching professional chess
  applications
- **Learning**: Unicode chess symbols are inadequate for professional
  iOS apps; vector image assets are required for quality presentation

**Oct 8, 2025**: Responsive piece sizing across devices
- **Problem**: Hardcoded 50x50 piece size resulted in tiny pieces on
  iPad and layout issues in landscape orientation
- **Solution**: Replaced fixed size with GeometryReader-based
  responsive sizing (pieces scale to 90% of square size with 10%
  padding)
- **Result**: Perfect piece scaling across iPhone, iPad, macOS, and
  all orientations
- **Learning**: Always use GeometryReader for content that must adapt
  to varying container sizes

### Time Controls System

**Architecture:** iOS-native implementation with separate White/Black settings

**Features:**
- Dual slider interface (minutes 0-60, increment 0-60 seconds)
- Segmented status picker (Enabled/Disabled)
- Quick presets (Blitz 5/0, Rapid 10/5, Classical 30/10, Terminal Default 30/10 vs 5/0)
- Bidirectional sync (status picker ‚Üî slider values)
- Main screen display with tappable time shortcut
- Game-start lock (warning displayed, enforcement in Phase 2)

**Persistence:** `@AppStorage` for whiteMinutes, whiteIncrement, blackMinutes, blackIncrement

### Opponent Selection System

**Architecture:** Multi-engine with protocol-based design for future expansion

**Current Implementation:**
- Stockfish (offline): Skill level 0-20 with slider, GPL license attribution
- Chess.com (placeholder): Future Phase 3 implementation
- Lichess (placeholder): Future Phase 2 implementation

**Persistence:** `@AppStorage` for selectedEngine and stockfishSkillLevel (default 5)

**Features:**
- Engine selection with checkmarks
- Skill level descriptions (Beginner/Casual/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert/Maximum)
- Main screen display shows "Opponent: Stockfish (Level X)"
- Game-start lock warning for skill changes

### Score Evaluation System

**Scale Formats:**
- Centipawns (standard chess engine format)
- Scaled (-9 to +9) - terminal project parity with conversion chart
- Win Probability (percentage format)

**Features:**
- Scale selection with @AppStorage persistence (default: "scaled")
- Conversion chart view (appears only when Scaled format selected)
- Complete centipawn mapping from terminal project

### Offer Draw System

**Architecture:** Skill-aware AI draw acceptance based on position evaluation

**Implementation:**
```swift
func offerDraw() async -> Bool {
    // Evaluate position from Stockfish
    let evaluation = try await engine.evaluatePosition(position: fen)

    // UCI evals are from White's perspective, flip for Black (AI)
    let blackEvaluation = -evaluation

    // Skill-aware threshold (lower skill = more willing to accept)
    let acceptThreshold = -(100 + (skillLevel * 10))

    // Accept only if losing badly
    return blackEvaluation < acceptThreshold
}
```

**Thresholds by Skill Level:**
- **Skill 5:** -150cp (accepts when losing 1.5+ pawns)
- **Skill 10:** -200cp (accepts when losing 2+ pawns)
- **Skill 20:** -300cp (accepts when losing 3+ pawns)

**UI Integration:**
- Located in Quick Game Menu between Flip Board and Resign
- Disabled until game starts and when playing against human
- Shows "Evaluating..." spinner during position analysis
- Alert displays accept/decline decision with appropriate message
- Red text matching Resign button style

**Testing FEN Strings:**
1. **White winning** (Black accepts): `8/8/8/8/4k3/8/8/3QK3 w - - 0 1`
2. **Black winning** (Black declines): `7k/8/3K4/8/8/8/8/q7 w - - 0 1`
3. **White minor edge** (Black declines): `rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1`
4. **Equal position** (Black declines): `rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1`

### FEN/PGN Navigation System (Phase 3 - Planned)

**Critical Feature:** Matches terminal project's LOAD FEN and LOAD PGN commands

**Terminal Project Reference (`../CLAUDE.md`):**
- LOAD FEN - Browse .fen files, 20-line pagination, arrow key navigation
- LOAD PGN - Browse .pgn files, move-by-move navigation with arrows
- FENNavigator structure with positions[], count, current index
- User navigates forward/backward, then cancels or continues from position

**iOS Implementation Plan:**

**UI Components:**
1. **File Picker** - iOS document picker for .fen/.pgn files
2. **PositionNavigatorView** - Modal view with:
   - Live chess board preview (updates as you navigate)
   - Position counter (e.g., "5 of 18")
   - Navigation controls (swipe gestures + buttons)
   - "Save Current Game" prompt before loading
   - "Play from Here" and "Cancel" buttons

**Navigation Controls:**
- Swipe right = Next position
- Swipe left = Previous position
- Slider = Jump to any position instantly
- Buttons = Prev/Next for non-swipe users

**User Flow:**
1. Tap "Import FEN" or "Import PGN" in Game Menu
2. iOS document picker appears ‚Üí select file
3. **"Save current game?"** alert appears (Yes/No/Cancel)
4. PositionNavigatorView modal opens
5. User navigates through positions (board updates live)
6. User taps "Play from Here" ‚Üí loads that position, dismisses
7. OR user taps "Cancel" ‚Üí dismisses without changes

**Educational Value (Critical!):**
- Study master games move-by-move
- Analyze opening sequences position by position
- Review your own games
- Learn from tactical positions
- **Superior to terminal:** Graphical board vs ASCII art

**Data Structure:**
```swift
struct PositionNavigator {
    var positions: [String]    // FEN strings
    var count: Int              // Total positions
    var currentIndex: Int       // Current position
    var metadata: String?       // PGN headers, game info
}
```

### Setup Game Board System (FEN Import - Testing Tool)

**Architecture:** Complete FEN parser matching terminal project's SETUP command

**Purpose:** Critical testing tool for development - allows immediate setup
of any chess position without playing through moves to reach it.

**NOTE:** This is different from "Import FEN" - SETUP takes a single FEN
string for immediate testing, while Import FEN loads multi-position files
with navigation.

**Implementation:**
- `ChessGame.setupFromFEN(_ fen: String) -> Bool` method parses complete FEN strings
- Validates all 6 FEN components: pieces, active player, castling rights,
  en passant target, halfmove clock, fullmove number
- Text input alert in GameMenuView for pasting FEN strings
- Automatic game state detection after setup (check/checkmate/stalemate)
- `.onAppear` and `.onChange(of: game.currentPlayer)` triggers in
  ChessBoardView detect non-move game states

**FEN Components Parsed:**
1. **Piece Placement**: 8 ranks separated by slashes, numbers = empty squares
2. **Active Player**: 'w' = White, 'b' = Black
3. **Castling Rights**: KQkq or dash (K=White kingside, Q=White queenside,
   k=Black kingside, q=Black queenside)
4. **En Passant Target**: Algebraic square or dash
5. **Halfmove Clock**: Moves since last pawn move or capture (50-move rule)
6. **Fullmove Number**: Full move count (increments after Black's move)

**User Access:** Game Menu ‚Üí "Setup Game Board" ‚Üí paste FEN ‚Üí immediate board update

**Future Enhancement (Phase 3):** Add "Save current game?" prompt before setup
if the current board position differs from the standard starting position. This
prevents accidental loss of in-progress games when testing new positions.

**Testing Value:** Essential for validating check/checkmate/stalemate, castling,
en passant, pawn promotion, 50-move rule, and complex positions without manual
move entry. Matches terminal project's SETUP function utility.

**Sample FEN Strings for Testing:**

See README.md for complete list. Key testing positions include:
- **Pawn Promotion (White)**: `8/4P3/8/8/8/8/8/4K2k w - - 0 1`
  - White pawn on e7, 2 moves from promotion to test all 4 pieces (Q/R/B/N)
- **Pawn Promotion (Black)**: `4k2K/8/8/8/8/8/4p3/8 b - - 0 1`
  - Black pawn on e2, 2 moves from promotion to test all 4 pieces
- **50-Move Rule Test**: `8/8/8/4k3/8/8/4K3/8 w - - 98 100`
  - Halfmove clock at 98, triggers draw alert after 2 more moves

### Auto-Save & File Management System (Phase 3 - Planned)

**Terminal Project Parity:**
- Terminal app auto-creates .fen and .pgn files on game exit
- User controls via PGNON/PGNOFF and FENON/FENOFF command line options
- Files saved to configured directories
- Filename format: `chess_game_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.fen/pgn`

**iOS Implementation Strategy:**

**Settings Configuration (SettingsView):**

1. **Auto-Save Toggles** (independent controls):
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí File Management
     ‚òë Auto-save FEN on game end (default: ON)
     ‚òë Auto-save PGN on game end (default: ON)
   ```
   - Matches terminal FENON/FENOFF and PGNON/PGNOFF behavior
   - User can enable FEN only, PGN only, both, or neither
   - Persisted via @AppStorage

2. **Save Location Picker:**
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí File Management ‚Üí Save Location
     ‚óã On My iPhone
     ‚óã iCloud Drive
   ```
   - iOS document picker for selecting folder
   - Defaults to app's Documents directory
   - Persisted path via @AppStorage
   - Future: Allow user to browse and select any Files app location

**Auto-Save on Game End:**

**Trigger Points:**
- Checkmate detected
- Stalemate detected
- Player resigns
- 50-move rule draw accepted

**Behavior:**
1. Game ends with result determined
2. If "Auto-save FEN" enabled:
   - Generate FEN string for final position
   - Save to: `{location}/position_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.fen`
3. If "Auto-save PGN" enabled:
   - Generate PGN with headers and full move history
   - Save to: `{location}/game_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pgn`
4. Show brief toast notification: "Game saved to Files" (or "Game saved to iCloud")
5. Continue with game-end alert (checkmate/stalemate message)

**PGN File Format:**
```
[Event "iPhone Game"]
[Site "Claude Chess iOS"]
[Date "2025.10.11"]
[Round "1"]
[White "Player"]
[Black "Stockfish Level 5"]
[Result "1-0"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. Qxf7# 1-0
```

**Share Game Feature (Mid-Game Sharing):**

**Location:** Game Menu ‚Üí "Share Game" (replaces Export FEN/Export PGN)

**Functionality:**
1. User taps "Share Game" during active game
2. Alert presents options:
   - Share FEN (current position only)
   - Share PGN (full game history to this point)
   - Share Both
3. iOS share sheet appears with:
   - AirDrop
   - Messages
   - Email
   - Copy to clipboard
   - Save to Files (manual save, not auto-save)
4. User selects destination

**Use Cases:**
- Send position to friend for analysis
- Share game-in-progress via email
- Copy FEN to paste into chess analysis tool
- AirDrop game to iPad for larger screen

**Implementation Requirements:**

**Data Tracking (New Requirements):**
- Move history array: `[(from: Position, to: Position, piece: Piece, captured: Piece?)]`
- Algebraic notation generator: Convert Position pairs to "e2e4", "Nf3", etc.
- Game metadata: start time, player names, result
- Move timestamps (for PGN comments)

**File Operations:**
```swift
// Settings persistence
@AppStorage("autoSaveFEN") var autoSaveFEN = true
@AppStorage("autoSavePGN") var autoSavePGN = true
@AppStorage("saveLocation") var saveLocation = "Documents"

// File generation
func generateFEN() -> String { /* ... */ }
func generatePGN() -> String { /* ... */ }

// Save to Files app
func saveFile(content: String, filename: String, location: URL) {
    // iOS FileManager operations
}

// Share sheet
func shareGame(fen: String?, pgn: String?) {
    let activityVC = UIActivityViewController(...)
}
```

**iOS Files App Integration:**
- Files appear in "On My iPhone" ‚Üí "Claude Chess" folder
- Or in "iCloud Drive" ‚Üí "Claude Chess" folder (if iCloud enabled)
- User can browse/manage saved games in Files app
- Files automatically available for Import FEN/Import PGN

**Error Handling:**
- Save location not accessible ‚Üí alert user, fall back to Documents
- iCloud not enabled ‚Üí alert user, offer Files alternative
- Disk space insufficient ‚Üí alert user
- Write permission denied ‚Üí alert user

**Phase 3 Implementation Order:**
1. Add move history tracking to ChessGame model
2. Implement algebraic notation generator
3. Create FEN/PGN string generation functions
4. Add Settings toggles and location picker
5. Implement auto-save on game end
6. Add "Share Game" button and iOS share sheet
7. Test file saving to Files app and iCloud
8. Verify round-trip (save ‚Üí import ‚Üí play)

### Future Considerations
- App Store deployment strategy
- Monetization approach (if any)
- Multi-platform support (iOS, iPadOS, macOS)
- Online gameplay features
- Additional chess piece styles (minimalist, Staunton, 3D rendered)
