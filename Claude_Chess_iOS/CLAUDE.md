## Development Standards (Inherited from Terminal Project)

### Mandatory Standards from Terminal Project

These standards are **NON-NEGOTIABLE** and carry over from the
terminal project:

1. **Documentation Line Length**: 80 characters maximum per line
   in ALL .md files
2. **Zero Warnings**: All code must compile with zero warnings
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: All features must have tests before
   completion
4. **Incremental Development**: Test after every significant change
5. **Professional Documentation**: All code fully documented with
   parameter descriptions
6. **No Session Crashes**: Never run full games during development
   sessions
7. **User Handles Git**: Developer never performs git operations
8. **TODO Management**: Actively monitor and remove TODO comments
   when functionality is implemented. Before marking any feature
   complete, search for related TODOs and remove them. See TODO
   Tracking section below for current inventory.

### Standards NOT Inherited (iOS-Specific Simplifications)

1. **Multi-Platform Testing**: Terminal project required testing on
   macOS, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi. iOS project targets single
   Apple ecosystem (iOS/iPadOS/macOS) via unified SwiftUI. Testing
   on iPhone Simulator validates all Apple platforms.

### iOS-Specific Additional Standards

1. **SwiftUI Best Practices** - Modern declarative UI patterns
2. **MVVM Architecture** - Clear separation of concerns
3. **Accessibility First** - VoiceOver support for all features
4. **60fps Performance** - Smooth animations, efficient updates
5. **Swift API Guidelines** - Follow Apple's naming conventions

### Documentation Standards (Critical - Prevent Doc Sprawl)

**Lessons Learned from Terminal Project:**
The terminal project's CLAUDE.md grew to ~1400 lines with significant
redundancy requiring multiple refactoring sessions. iOS project
standards prevent this issue.

**Mandatory Documentation Practices:**

1. **Session History - Stay Concise**
   - Focus on KEY DECISIONS and ARCHITECTURE CHOICES only
   - Do NOT document every code change or file modification
   - Keep entries to 3-5 bullet points maximum per session
   - Bad: "Updated line 47 in FileX.swift to fix typo"
   - Good: "Implemented custom color picker with live preview"

2. **No Duplicate Feature Documentation**
   - Document each feature ONCE in its logical section
   - "Latest Progress" and "Implementation Progress" must stay
     synchronized
   - Do NOT replicate architecture details across sections
   - Cross-reference with "See Section X" when needed

3. **Implementation Progress Section**
   - Keep completed items as brief bullet points
   - Do NOT expand with implementation details (those go in
     dedicated sections)
   - Update status (‚úÖ/üîÑ/üìã) without expanding text unnecessarily

4. **Avoid "Recently Completed" Lists**
   - Terminal project suffered from ever-growing "Recently
     Completed" sections
   - Move completed items to appropriate permanent sections
   - Session History captures temporal progression

5. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Document new systems ONCE in dedicated subsection
   - Example: "Board Color Theme System" documents entire feature
   - Do NOT repeat details in Session History or Implementation
     Progress

**Review Checkpoints:**
- Every 3-4 sessions: Scan for redundancy
- Before Phase transitions: Consolidate documentation
- Flag if CLAUDE.md approaches 1000+ lines

**Current Status:** ~900 lines (healthy), no redundancy detected

### Code Style
- Swift API Design Guidelines compliance
- Clear, self-documenting function names
- Comprehensive inline comments for complex logic
- Organized file structure with clear module boundaries

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for chess logic (move validation, game rules)
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for board rendering
- Integration tests for AI opponent

### TODO Tracking System

**Purpose:** Monitor in-code TODO comments to ensure completion and
prevent accumulation of technical debt.

**Current TODO Inventory (20 total as of Oct 11, 2025):**

**Phase 2 - Move Validation & Game Logic (2 TODOs):**
- `MoveValidator.swift` - Add check detection to prevent castling while in check
- `MoveValidator.swift` - Add is_square_attacked() checks for squares king moves through

**Phase 2 - UI & Display (4 TODOs):**
- `HintView.swift` - Implement actual hint functionality
- `ContentView.swift` - Implement captured pieces calculation
- `ScoreView.swift` - Display current position evaluation
- `ScoreView.swift` - Display game statistics

**Phase 3 - Game Management (12 TODOs):**
- `ChessGame.swift` - Track captured pieces for display
- `GameMenuView.swift` - Save game action
- `GameMenuView.swift` - Load game action
- `GameMenuView.swift` - Undo move action (2 locations: GameMenuView + QuickGameMenuView)
- `GameMenuView.swift` - Import FEN action
- `GameMenuView.swift` - Export FEN action
- `GameMenuView.swift` - Import PGN action
- `GameMenuView.swift` - Export PGN action
- `GameMenuView.swift` - Resign action (2 locations: GameMenuView + QuickGameMenuView)
- `QuickGameMenuView.swift` - FEN display implementation
- `QuickGameMenuView.swift` - PGN display implementation

**Future/Optional (1 TODO):**
- `AboutView.swift` - Add any other third-party libraries used
  (appropriate placeholder for future dependencies)

**Active Maintenance Protocol (MANDATORY):**

**When ADDING a TODO to code:**
1. Add the TODO comment to the code file
2. IMMEDIATELY update this TODO Tracking section
3. Categorize by phase (Phase 2/3/Future)
4. Update the total count at top of inventory

**When REMOVING a TODO from code:**
1. Remove the TODO comment from the code file
2. IMMEDIATELY remove from this TODO Tracking section
3. Update the total count at top of inventory
4. Mention removal in Session History if feature-significant

**Before marking ANY feature complete:**
1. Search: `grep -r "TODO" . | grep [feature_name]`
2. Remove ALL related TODOs from code
3. Remove ALL related TODOs from this tracking section
4. Verify with second grep search
5. Update total count

**Weekly audit during active development:**
- Run: `grep -r "TODO" Claude_Chess/Claude_Chess/` to verify
- Check for orphaned TODOs not in this tracking system
- Check for tracking entries without corresponding code TODOs
- Update inventory immediately if discrepancies found

**This tracking system is USELESS unless actively maintained!**

## Multi-Engine AI Architecture

### Design Decision: Flexible Engine Selection

**Approved Architecture:** Protocol-based multi-engine system allowing
users to select their preferred AI opponent for each game session.

**Supported Engines:**
1. **Stockfish (Native)** - Offline play, UCI protocol, skill 0-20
2. **Lichess API** - Online play, cloud analysis, rating ~800-2800
3. **Chess.com API** - Online play, multiple skill levels

### Implementation Strategy: Protocol Pattern

```swift
// Core protocol defining chess engine behavior
protocol ChessEngine {
    func getBestMove(position: String, skillLevel: Int) async -> Move?
    func getHint(position: String) async -> Move?
    func evaluatePosition(position: String) async -> Int?
    func setSkillLevel(_ level: Int)
    var engineName: String { get }
    var requiresInternet: Bool { get }
}

// Three concrete implementations
class StockfishEngine: ChessEngine {
    // UCI protocol communication (terminal project parity)
}

class LichessEngine: ChessEngine {
    // REST/WebSocket API integration
}

class ChessComEngine: ChessEngine {
    // REST API integration
}

// Game uses selected engine
class ChessGame {
    var currentEngine: ChessEngine
    // All AI requests go through protocol methods
}
```

### User Experience

**Engine Selection UI:**
```
Settings ‚Üí Opponent Selection
  ‚óã Stockfish (Offline, Skill 0-20)
  ‚óã Lichess (Online, Rating 800-2800)
  ‚óã Chess.com (Online, Beginner-Master)
```

**Per-Game Configuration:** Engine preference saved with each game,
not globally. Allows flexibility:
- Casual offline game ‚Üí Stockfish level 5
- Serious study ‚Üí Lichess 2000 rating
- Tournament prep ‚Üí Chess.com Master

### Phased Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Stockfish Native Integration (MVP)**
- Status: **PRIMARY FOCUS** for initial release
- Compile Stockfish as iOS framework/library
- Implement UCI protocol communication (terminal project parity)
- Establish ChessEngine protocol architecture
- Complete offline play capability
- Validate all chess logic ports correctly
- **Goal:** Feature parity with terminal version

**Phase 2: Lichess API Integration**
- Status: **POST-MVP ENHANCEMENT**
- Implement LichessEngine conforming to protocol
- Add OAuth authentication for user accounts
- Integrate opening explorer and cloud analysis
- Handle network connectivity and error cases
- Add engine selection UI
- **Goal:** Online play and cloud features

**Phase 3: Chess.com API Integration**
- Status: **FUTURE ENHANCEMENT**
- Implement ChessComEngine conforming to protocol
- Complete three-engine comparison features
- Polish UI for multi-engine system
- Add engine performance analytics
- **Goal:** Maximum flexibility and choice

### Technical Considerations

**Advantages:**
- Clean separation via protocol-based design
- Engine-agnostic chess logic (already true from C port)
- User flexibility for different play styles
- Offline capability maintained (Stockfish)
- Online features available when desired (APIs)

**Challenges:**
- API rate limits (Lichess/Chess.com usage restrictions)
- Skill level mapping (Stockfish 0-20 vs rating systems)
- Network error handling and offline detection
- Testing complexity (need to mock network engines)
- Feature parity (some features engine-specific)

**Mitigation:**
- Phased implementation manages complexity
- Protocol abstraction isolates engine differences
- Graceful degradation for network failures
- Comprehensive unit tests with mocked engines

### Integration Points

**Existing Systems:**
- Chess logic layer remains engine-agnostic
- FEN/PGN handling works with all engines
- Time control system applies to all engines
- Hint system uses same protocol method across engines

**New Requirements:**
- Network connectivity monitoring
- API authentication management (OAuth)
- Engine preference persistence
- Rate limit tracking and throttling

## Technical Advantages

### Code Reusability
- Chess logic algorithms translate directly from C to Swift
- Existing validation and testing patterns applicable
- UCI protocol knowledge directly transferable (if using
  Stockfish)
- File format handling (FEN/PGN) preservable
- All edge cases and bug fixes already documented

### Development Efficiency
- Complete requirements already established

```swift
// To be implemented - examples:

enum PieceType {
    case pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, king
}

enum Color {
    case white, black
}

struct Position {
    let row: Int
    let col: Int
}

struct Piece {
    let type: PieceType
    let color: Color
}

struct ChessGame {
    var board: [[Piece?]]
    var currentPlayer: Color
    var whiteKingPos: Position
    var blackKingPos: Position
    // ... additional game state
}
```

### Key Decisions

**Oct 1, 2025**: Multi-engine AI architecture approved - Protocol-
based design supporting Stockfish (native), Lichess API, and
Chess.com API with phased implementation (Stockfish Phase 1/MVP,
Lichess Phase 2, Chess.com Phase 3)

**Oct 8, 2025**: Color definition strategy - Used file-level
fileprivate constants with fully-qualified SwiftUI.Color type to
avoid initializer ambiguity issues

**Oct 8, 2025**: Chess piece graphics - Adopted Cburnett SVG assets
from Wikimedia Commons for professional appearance, rejecting Unicode
symbols due to unprofessional "hollow/sketch" appearance of white
pieces

**Oct 8, 2025**: Settings architecture - Implemented extensible
navigation-based settings system early in Phase 1 to establish proper
architecture before Phase 2 complexity. Custom color feature added as
first user customization option with full persistence support.

**Oct 8, 2025**: Header layout - Decided against tab bar approach for
Settings/Game Menu icons. Keeping both as modal sheets accessed from
header maximizes board space and follows iOS conventions for action
menus vs navigation sections.

**Oct 9, 2025**: Dual access patterns - Retained features in both main
view shortcuts (time controls, opponent, hint) AND hamburger menu for
dual discovery mechanisms respecting different user interaction styles.

**Theme Model** (`BoardColorTheme.swift`):
```swift
struct BoardColorTheme: Identifiable, Codable, Equatable {
    let id: String
    let name: String
    let lightSquare: ColorComponents
    let darkSquare: ColorComponents
}
```

**Preset Themes**:
1. **Classic** - Traditional tan/brown (default)
2. **Wooden** - Warm amber/dark brown with golden light squares
3. **Blue** - Cool blue tones
4. **Green** - Forest green with light squares
5. **Marble** - Elegant grey/white
6. **Tournament** - High contrast white/dark green
7. **Custom** - User-defined colors via color picker

**Persistence Implementation**:
- Theme selection: `@AppStorage("boardThemeId")`
- Custom colors: 6 separate `@AppStorage` properties for RGB
  components
  - `customLightRed`, `customLightGreen`, `customLightBlue`
  - `customDarkRed`, `customDarkGreen`, `customDarkBlue`
- Values persist in UserDefaults across app kills and device restarts

**Custom Color Picker Features**:
- Live 4x4 chess board preview showing actual color appearance
- Separate ColorPicker controls for light and dark squares
- Real-time preview updates as colors change
- Automatic theme switching to "custom" when colors modified
- RGB component extraction from SwiftUI.Color via UIColor bridge

**Technical Implementation**:
- `BoardColorTheme.componentsFrom(color:)` converts SwiftUI.Color to
  RGB using UIColor
- `BoardColorTheme.theme(withId:customLight:customDark:)` returns
  custom theme with user colors
- ChessBoardView reads both theme ID and custom colors from
  @AppStorage
- Dynamic theme resolution in `currentTheme` computed property

**User Experience Flow**:
1. Tap gear icon in ContentView
2. Navigate to "Board Colors" in SettingsView
3. Select preset theme (immediate preview) OR tap "Custom"
4. Custom picker shows live 4x4 board preview
5. Adjust light/dark square colors independently
6. Return to game - board reflects new colors
7. Colors persist even after app termination

### Chess Piece Assets

**License**: CC-BY-SA 3.0 (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike)
**Creator**: User:Cburnett
**URL**: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_chess_pieces

**Assets Used** (12 SVG files):
- White pieces: `Chess_klt45.svg`, `Chess_qlt45.svg`, `Chess_rlt45.svg`,
  `Chess_blt45.svg`, `Chess_nlt45.svg`, `Chess_plt45.svg`
- Black pieces: `Chess_kdt45.svg`, `Chess_qdt45.svg`, `Chess_rdt45.svg`,
  `Chess_bdt45.svg`, `Chess_ndt45.svg`, `Chess_pdt45.svg`

**File Naming Convention**:
- Format: `Chess_XYZ45.svg`
- X = piece letter (k=king, q=queen, r=rook, b=bishop, n=knight,
  p=pawn)
- Y = color (l=light/white, d=dark/black)
- Z = background (t=transparent)
- 45 = size reference

**Implementation Details**:
- Assets stored in `Assets.xcassets` catalog
- `PieceType.assetName(for:)` method maps pieces to asset names
- `Piece.assetName` property provides convenient access
- ChessBoardView uses `Image()` with `.resizable()` and
  `.aspectRatio()` for proper scaling
- Vector graphics scale perfectly on all iOS devices

**Attribution**: These chess pieces are widely used across Wikipedia,
chess.com (early versions), and numerous chess applications. The
Cburnett style is considered a standard for digital chess
representation.

### Technical Challenges Resolved

**Oct 8, 2025**: SwiftUI Color initializer ambiguity
- **Problem**: Color(red:green:blue:) was being misinterpreted as
  Decodable initializer
- **Solution**: Moved color definitions to file-level constants with
  explicit SwiftUI.Color type qualification
- **Learning**: SwiftUI color initialization in struct properties can
  have type inference issues; file-level constants avoid this

**Oct 8, 2025**: Chess piece visual quality
- **Problem**: Unicode chess symbols (‚ôî‚ôï‚ôñ‚ôó‚ôò‚ôô) rendered with
  unprofessional "hollow/sketch" appearance for white pieces
- **Attempted Solutions**: SF Symbols (not available), solid Unicode
  with white fill (foregroundColor doesn't work on emoji-style glyphs),
  white background circles (visually unappealing)
- **Final Solution**: Professional SVG assets from Wikimedia Commons
  (Cburnett pieces)
- **Result**: App Store-quality graphics matching professional chess
  applications
- **Learning**: Unicode chess symbols are inadequate for professional
  iOS apps; vector image assets are required for quality presentation

**Oct 8, 2025**: Responsive piece sizing across devices
- **Problem**: Hardcoded 50x50 piece size resulted in tiny pieces on
  iPad and layout issues in landscape orientation
- **Solution**: Replaced fixed size with GeometryReader-based
  responsive sizing (pieces scale to 90% of square size with 10%
  padding)
- **Result**: Perfect piece scaling across iPhone, iPad, macOS, and
  all orientations
- **Learning**: Always use GeometryReader for content that must adapt
  to varying container sizes

### Time Controls System

**Architecture:** iOS-native implementation with separate White/Black settings

**Features:**
- Dual slider interface (minutes 0-60, increment 0-60 seconds)
- Segmented status picker (Enabled/Disabled)
- Quick presets (Blitz 5/0, Rapid 10/5, Classical 30/10, Terminal Default 30/10 vs 5/0)
- Bidirectional sync (status picker ‚Üî slider values)
- Main screen display with tappable time shortcut
- Game-start lock (warning displayed, enforcement in Phase 2)

**Persistence:** `@AppStorage` for whiteMinutes, whiteIncrement, blackMinutes, blackIncrement

### Opponent Selection System

**Architecture:** Multi-engine with protocol-based design for future expansion

**Current Implementation:**
- Stockfish (offline): Skill level 0-20 with slider, GPL license attribution
- Chess.com (placeholder): Future Phase 3 implementation
- Lichess (placeholder): Future Phase 2 implementation

**Persistence:** `@AppStorage` for selectedEngine and stockfishSkillLevel (default 5)

**Features:**
- Engine selection with checkmarks
- Skill level descriptions (Beginner/Casual/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert/Maximum)
- Main screen display shows "Opponent: Stockfish (Level X)"
- Game-start lock warning for skill changes

### Score Evaluation System

**Scale Formats:**
- Centipawns (standard chess engine format)
- Scaled (-9 to +9) - terminal project parity with conversion chart
- Win Probability (percentage format)

**Features:**
- Scale selection with @AppStorage persistence (default: "scaled")
- Conversion chart view (appears only when Scaled format selected)
- Complete centipawn mapping from terminal project

### Future Considerations
- App Store deployment strategy
- Monetization approach (if any)
- Multi-platform support (iOS, iPadOS, macOS)
- Online gameplay features
- Additional chess piece styles (minimalist, Staunton, 3D rendered)
