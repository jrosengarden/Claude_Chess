# Claude Chess iOS

A native iOS chess application built with SwiftUI, featuring a complete
chess implementation with AI opponent integration.

## Important: Relationship to Terminal Project

This iOS app is a direct port of the terminal-based Claude Chess
project located in the parent directory (`../`).

**For Developers**: All feature specifications, chess logic, and
development standards are documented in `../CLAUDE.md`. The terminal
project is the authoritative source for how chess features should
behave.

**File Organization**:
```

Always consult the terminal project documentation before implementing
any feature.

from the proven terminal-based implementation.

## Setup Game Board Feature (Testing Tool)

The "Setup Game Board" feature allows you to set up any chess position
by pasting a FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string. This is invaluable
for testing specific scenarios, studying positions, or starting games
from non-standard positions.

### How to Use
1. Tap the hamburger menu (â˜°) in the top-left corner
2. Select "Game Menu"
3. Tap "Setup Game Board"
4. Paste a valid FEN string
5. Tap "Setup" - the board immediately updates to that position

The app automatically detects check, checkmate, and stalemate conditions
after setting up the position.

### Sample FEN Strings for Testing

#### 1. Scholar's Mate (Checkmate Position)
```
r1bqkb1r/pppp1Qpp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 4
```
Black is in checkmate. Tests checkmate detection with immediate alert.

#### 2. Stalemate Position
```
7k/8/6Q1/8/8/8/8/K7 b - - 0 1
```
Black king on h8, White king on a1, White queen on g6. Black has no
legal moves but isn't in check = stalemate draw.

#### 3. En Passant Opportunity
```
rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/8/3pPp2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6 0 3
```
White pawn on e5, Black pawn just moved to f5. White can capture en
passant on f6 by moving the e5 pawn diagonally to f6.

#### 4. Castling Rights Test (No Castling Available)
```
r3k2r/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/R3K2R w - - 0 1
```
Kings and rooks in position but no castling rights (dash after w).
Tests that castling is properly disabled even when pieces are in
starting squares.

#### 5. Midgame Position with Castling Available
```
r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 5
```
Italian Game opening position. Both sides can still castle kingside
and queenside. Tests castling availability mid-game.

#### 6. Endgame - King and Pawn vs King
```
8/8/8/4k3/8/8/4P3/4K3 w - - 0 1
```
Simple endgame: White king e1, White pawn e2, Black king e5. Tests
minimal piece setup and basic endgame scenarios.

#### 7. White Pawn Promotion (2 moves away)
```
8/4P3/8/8/8/8/8/4K2k w - - 0 1
```
White pawn on e7, two moves away from e8 promotion. White king on e1,
Black king on h1. Tests pawn promotion for all 4 piece types (Queen,
Rook, Bishop, Knight).

#### 8. Black Pawn Promotion (2 moves away)
```
4k2K/8/8/8/8/8/4p3/8 b - - 0 1
```
Black pawn on e2, two moves away from e1 promotion. Black king on e8,
White king on h8. Tests pawn promotion for Black with all 4 piece types.

#### 9. 50-Move Rule Test (2 moves away from draw)
```
8/8/8/4k3/8/8/4K3/8 w - - 98 100
```
Only kings remain, halfmove clock at 98. After 2 more moves (one by
White, one by Black), the clock reaches 100 and triggers the 50-move
rule draw alert.

### Testing Tips
- After setting up any position, try moving pieces to verify the board
  state is legal
- Check that castling rights are correctly set (try castling if available)
- Verify en passant works with position #3
- Confirm check/checkmate/stalemate detection with positions #1 and #2
- Test pawn promotion with positions #7 and #8 (all 4 piece types)
- Verify 50-move rule draw with position #9
- Use this feature during development to quickly test specific game
  situations
  
### Additional FEN Strings for Testing Castling Rules + King in Check Rules
	(after adding restrictions not allowing King to castle thru check)
	(or to move thru check)

 Test 1: White in Check - Should NOT Allow Castling

  r3k2r/8/8/8/8/8/8/R3K1qR w KQkq - 0 1
  White king on e1, Black queen on g1 puts White in check. Castling should be BLOCKED 
  (both kingside and queenside).

  Test 2: White Kingside - Square King Moves Through is Attacked

  r3k2r/8/8/8/8/5b2/8/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 1
  White king on e1, Black bishop on f3 attacks f1 (square king moves through). Only 
  kingside castling should be BLOCKED. Queenside should still work.
  
	Test #2 CORRECTED - Kingside blocked (f1 attacked):
  	r3k2r/8/8/8/8/8/5q2/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 1
  	Black queen on f2 attacks f1 (blocks kingside castling), but queenside should work!

  Test 3: White Queenside - Square King Moves Through is Attacked

  r3k2r/8/8/8/8/3b4/8/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 1
  White king on e1, Black bishop on d3 attacks d1 (square king moves through). 
  Only queenside castling should be BLOCKED. Kingside should still work.

  Test 4: Black in Check - Should NOT Allow Castling

  r3k2r/8/8/8/8/8/8/R3K1QR b KQkq - 0 1
  Black king on e8, White queen on g8 puts Black in check. Castling should be 
  BLOCKED (both sides).
  
	Test #4 CORRECTED - Black in Check (no castling at all):
	r3k2r/8/8/8/4Q3/8/8/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 1
  	White Queen on e4 puts Black king on e8 in check (vertical attack up column e). 
  	Both castling directions should be BLOCKED.

  Test 5: Both Sides Can Castle (Control Test)

  r3k2r/8/8/8/8/8/8/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 1
  No attacks, no check. BOTH players should be able to castle both directions. 
  This verifies we didn't break normal castling.

  Test in order - #5 first to confirm castling still works, then #1-4 to verify the 
  new restrictions!


## Xcode Project Structure

**Developer Note:** All development work occurs within the Xcode
project directory. User works in Xcode IDE with `Claude_Chess.xcodeproj`
loaded for builds, simulator testing, and visual verification.
