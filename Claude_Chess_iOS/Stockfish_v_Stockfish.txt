Analysis:  White gained a significant advantage by move #5 (14.2 cp). From that point on
		   our iOS AI Engine was simply scrambling and could never get an edge or push
		   back on White.  Black (our iOS AI Engine) made good use of it's allocated
		   30 minutes (with 10 second increments).  The move times for our iOS AI Engine
		   were not "robotic" at all this game.  Sometimes our iOS AI Engine moved
		   quickly and other times it pondered a bit.  Never anything to make me feel
		   that "this isn't right" if I was a human player going up against this
		   Stockfish 17 Engine (even though our iOS AI Engine was at Skill Level 5 while
		   the Stockfish 17.1 External Game/Engine was at Skill Level 20.)
		   
Conclusion: I believe our iOS AI Engine played a good game with such a skill level 
			handicap.

Analysis:  The External Stockfish Game/Engine started gaining the upperhand around move
		   #12 but our iOS Stockfish Engine kept pushing back taking away the minimal
		   upperhand so it was basically still an even game. The External Stockfish 
		   Engine/Game kept trying to gain the upperhand but it just went back and forth
		   with the External Stockfish Engine slowly increasing it's gain (albiet an
		   upperhand of ~100 cp). Around move #44 the External Stockfish Engine/Game 
		   actually had a gain of 350 cp - pretty significant! However at move #46 our
		   iOS AI Engine erased that entire advantage back to a dead even game (and the
		   external Stockfish Engine/Game was now predicting a 99% game draw at this
			point.)  From this point (move #46) on neither side could gain any advantage
			and just started trading material heading for a draw....which is exactly what
			happened.	
		   
Conclusion: I believe our iOS AI Engine played a great game, battling back from a 
			350 cp disadvantage to a draw!  THAT is MUCH stronger playing then we
			would see from a human player (who isn't a grandmaster).  It actually
			played a phenomenal game when Black only had a pawn and a King left and
			White had a knight and a king.  Black was desperately trying to push 
			that last pawn into a promotion, using it's king to protect it as it 
			tried to push it forward but White played a stellar game with it's 
			knight and king, battling for a couple of moves until White "won" and
			captured the pawn....albiet at the expense of loosing it's knight thus
			forcing the draw but....as I watched I was amazed at how our iOS
			AI Engine was craftily beating off the white knight time and time again!
						
			I think this "puts to rest" that our throttling of the iOS Stockfish engine
			would be crippling it's game.  I don't think that is the case at all.  Also
			in this game, as well as the 1st game, the moves were not "robotic" and the
			time to move changed +/- along the way.
			
SERIOUS QUESTION:  Why did our iOS App not declare a draw when there were only 2 kings
				   remaining.  Did we miss this chess rule (insufficient material?)
