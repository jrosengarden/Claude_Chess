The following explains what we're doing today:

1.	Read the 2 project markdown documents in this directory; 
	claude.md = developer/project doc & readme.md = user doc

1.	Our next session had been planned to be Session #25 and is documented in the
	SESSION_START.md file in this directory.
	
2.	However we never got to that SESSION_START.md doc (which would have been, I think
	Session #25) due to me reporting a serious issue that we needed to dive into.
	
3.	That session which was exported to Session_26_Export.txt will bring you up to speed
	on the issue(s) we were facing and where we left things at the end of that session.
	Reading this doc will bring you fully up to speed on where we are with these pblms.
	
4.	Before we dig into this I have one more "side trip" I'd like us to take first.  
	Please read the User_Guide_Feature.txt.  This will tell you what I'd like to do
	for this "side trip"
	
So to recap - for this session:

	1.	Read the following docs (located in this directory) in the order give:
		A.	claude.md & readme.md	
		B.	SESSION_START.md
		C.	Session_26_Export.txt
		D.	User_Guide_Feature.txt
		
	2.	We'll work on these projects in the reverse order:
		A. 	User_Guide_Feature.txt (fairly minor UI enhancement that has nothing to do
			with game play operations.)
		B.	Session_26_Export.txt (we need to work on these pblms CAREFULLY and not just
			dive right into adding new "band-aids"...as the document describes at the
			end.  There is no moving forward on this project until these issues are
			totally, and clearly, fixed)
		C.	SESSION_START.md (when we've completed the two above items we'll FINALLY
			be ready to get back to where we were...but understand it will NOT be 
			session #25 as indicated in the document)
			

I only created this GetOrganized.txt doc for you to read to get where we are and what 
needs to be done, in what order, for both YOUR benefit and MINE...since things were 
getting slightly "complicated".

Let mw know you understand and then we can dig in!
