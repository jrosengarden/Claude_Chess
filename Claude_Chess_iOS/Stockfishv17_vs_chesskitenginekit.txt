Game #1:Both our iOS app and the Stockfish app were set at Skill Level 20
		Both our iOS app and the Stockfish app had time controls off
		The Stockfish app was giving me the moves for White
		The iOS app's AI Engine (Stockfish) was making the moves for Black
		Result: White (Stockfish app) beat our iOS App but it took 36 moves
		NOTE:  The Stockfish app was winning most of the way but the AI Engine (Black)
				was making decent moves and fighting back.  I think me giving the
				Stockfish app a minimum of 30 seconds to calculate it's move was
				the advantage it "used" to win!!  Additionally the Stockfish app's
				advantage started getting very large (+5~, +6~, +7~) in the later
				moves so it got to a point where it was clear our iOS app's AI
				Engine was not, could not, win.

Game #2:Both our iOS app and the Stockfish app were set at Skill Level 20
		The time controls were: 30/10/5/0
		The Stockfish app was giving me the moves for White
		The iOS app's AI Engine (Stockfish) was making the moves for Black
		Result: White lost on a time forfeit (shock!)  Black still had about 23
				seconds remaining (which was phenomenal use of the 5 minutes
				it had started with..."managing" it's 5 minutes thru 61 moves!)
		NOTES:  I was giving the Stockfish app at least 30 seconds per move
				for it to calculate the move that it was giving me
				
				The game was fairly even up thru about move 20 (or so) and
				then the Stockfish app started VERY SLOWLY pulling ahead.  This
				is kind of clear since the game was at 61 moves before the time
				forfeit.  However, even at the time of White's forfeit it was only
				showing a "decent" advantage of roughly 2.7 (can't remember exactly).
				It never achieved the HUGE advantage(s) that it was gaining in the
				previous game.
				I'm only guessing here but I think that if White (me) hadn't run
				out of time this game would have would up as King vs King with 
				nothing else on the board!

iOS App Notes (things we need to fix):	
	1.	We are not including + sign, in the PGN, when there is a check
		Example: e5xf6+  -this indicates that the move resulted in check
	2.	We are not including # sign, in the PGN, when there is a checkmate
		Example:  e5xf6# -this indicates that the moves resulted in checkmate
	
Conclusion: I think our AI Engine is playing smart and strong.  
			When there were no time controls it took the Stockfish app 36 moves to 
			checkmate our iOS app AI engine.
			When there were time controls (30/10/5/0) the iOS Stockfish engine played an
			awfully strong game considering it started with 5 minutes and due to our
			coded controls (1/20th of the remaining time I think) it started moving
			quicker and quicker and quicker...but STILL played strong...to the point of
			White wound up with a time forfeit (mostly because I was purposly giving the
			Stockfish app a minimum of 30 seconds per move so it could dive as deep as
			possible in that 30 seconds..so White inadvertently ran out of time)
