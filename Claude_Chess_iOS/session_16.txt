Session 16 Bug Fix - Time Controls Lock Timing

Bug: Time controls not locked immediately after "Start Game" button tapped
- Time controls remained unlocked until first move was made
- User could modify settings after game started but before first move

Root Cause:
- TimeControlsView.swift gameStarted computed property only checked:
  * !game.moveHistory.isEmpty (requires at least one move)
  * game.timeControlsDisabledByUndo (only set after undo)
- Missing check for game.gameInProgress (set by "Start Game" button)

Fix:
- Added game.gameInProgress to gameStarted condition (line 35)
- Updated documentation comment to reflect three lock conditions

Files Modified:
- TimeControlsView.swift

Testing Verified:
✅ Time controls lock immediately when "Start Game" tapped
✅ Lock persists after first move
✅ Lock persists throughout game
✅ Lock releases on New Game
✅ All slider and preset controls properly disabled when locked

Status: Bug resolved. Zero warnings. Ready for commit.
