The .fen files in this directory cover 12 classic openings.  They are best used
with the Chess games "LOAD" function.  This function allows you to LOAD a complete
.fen file and then step forwards/backwards thru the game.  This will allow you to 
study this opening.  At any point that you want to play the game from the point you
have stepped to just press ENTER at that point.  The Chess game will then create a
new .fen file (time/date stamped) for the game you are about to start playing. This
new .fen file will include ALL of the moves subsequent to the point you decided to
start playing the game.

The classic opening .fen files have been certified as correct technically as well as
exactly representing the moves for the opening in question.

ENJOY!
